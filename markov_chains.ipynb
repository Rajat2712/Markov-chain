      "He must have disappeared in the forest the moment Henry Collins had told him what was afoot, for there could be no doubt Collins had informed him. After the moon rose, so that he could see well, Lumley must have come to the cabin, stolen food and candles, cautiously removed the aerial and grounded the battery, and gone straight down the valley to set his fires. If he could not get the money for the timber, or at least some of it, quite evidently Lumley did not intend to allow any one else to have it, not even the state.  In his own mind Charley had no doubt whatever that the incendiary was Lumley, and that he had done exactly the things Charley pictured him as doing. Even now he must be somewhere in the forest. But Charley felt relieved when he realized that in all probability Lumley had no firearms. He must have fled without taking time to equip himself. Also Charley doubted if he would remain in the forest. The forester would be certain to scour the woods for him, and Lumley could hardly hope to evade pursuit indefinitely. He would probably make his way out of the forest at some distant point and try to get away. Sooner or later, Charley felt sure, the man would be captured and doubtless sent to prison for cheating the state. It made Charley feel bad to think that he did not have enough direct evidence to insure Lumley's conviction for arson as well.  An idea came to Charley. Blowing away the remaining dust and ashes, Charley once more began an examination of the little excavation. Inch by inch he scrutinized the surface of the pit. He found it partly baked. Suddenly he gave a cry. He had found the distinct prints of some one's fingers. On the second side of the excavation he found more prints, and the third side yielded still others. Carefully Charley chopped out the incriminating bits of clay. When he laid them side by side and examined them under his microscope, he found they had been made, not by one person, but by three. Apparently each side of the pit had been fashioned by a different man.     Chapter XXVII  Trapped    While Charley was turning the matter over in his mind, the forester suddenly appeared. Charley gave a glad cry when he saw him.  \"Did you get them all out?\" he asked anxiously.  \"All will be out in a short time,\" was the reply. \"Morton and his big gang crossed directly into the other valley when I came here with my crew. As soon as we had finished your job here, we hustled over to the other valley. The fires there had spread considerably, but as there was little wind and we had a big force of men, we quickly got them under control. The minute I was satisfied we had them in hand, I came back to see how you were. Jim is in charge over there, so everything will be all right. How are you?\"  \"All O.K.,\" said Charley, \"but I guess I must have been about all in when you got here. I don't remember much about it.\"  \"Yes, you were about gone. We got to you just in time. Now tell me what you know about this fire.\"  The two men sat down in the shade and Charley told his chief all that had happened to him since the two had parted on the preceding evening. When he showed the forester the marks in the clay, the forester was elated.  \"He's a pretty clever rascal who doesn't trip himself up somewhere,\" chuckled the ranger. \"What happened is as clear as daylight. Collins and his companion found this clay while they were inspecting your camp. They must have suspected that it was fire-clay and that you had found a deposit of value. They took some along to test, and rolled what was left into a ball again, thinking you would never notice the difference. But they forgot that clay would take finger-prints so readily, and they have left their calling cards behind them.\"  The ranger carefully wrapped the clay ball in his handkerchief, and then in a newspaper. \"Let me have this,\" he said. \"The police may have some duplicate prints somewhere. We don't know what Collins and his pal are up to, but we have something here that we may find very useful. It isn't every crook that is so considerate as to leave his thumb-prints behind him.\"     Chapter XVI  Good News For the Fire Patrol    As the ranger had foretold, the forest guards did indeed pull foot early in the morning. Black darkness still enfolded the camp when the ranger awoke his young companions. Fire was speedily kindled and breakfast gotten under way.  \"Better eat your meat, boys,\" suggested the ranger. \"Otherwise it will keep that cat hanging around here. We'll hardly dare to leave the pup behind again, and that beast might get in here and tear your tent to pieces. These cats play hob with things sometimes.\"  Lew decided that he would carry nothing back with him, as he contemplated visiting his chum at intervals.  \"Just take your rifle,\" said the ranger to Charley. \"You'll be all alone on your return trip and with two such animals as we've seen hereabout, it will be just as well to have it. If I were you, I believe I'd make a pretty close companion of it and always keep it within reach.\"  When they left the camp, they were burdened only with Charley's rifle and food for the noon meal, which they stowed in their pockets. The instant there was light enough to guide their footsteps, the trio set forth.  For hours they trudged through the forest, for the most part in silence. Although they traveled by a circuitous route, and with eyes and ears alert, they neither saw nor heard anything that pointed to the presence of other human beings in the forest. The ground bore no telltale footprints. No incriminating marks were discernible on the trees. Smoke was nowhere visible. No firearm disturbed the silence of the wilderness. No birds flew upward with cries of alarm, save at their own approach. And the only voices that were audible were the voices of the brooks.  Under other circumstances Charley would have been supremely happy. The sun came up bright and clear, flirting with the fleecy clouds in the sky, that now plunged the land in deep shadow and again drew aside so that the forest was bathed in golden sunlight. The earth sent forth fragrant exhalations. A gentle breeze lent a tonic quality to the atmosphere. The leaves sparkled with dew, and the stream in the bottom flashed in the sunlight, filling the woods with its sonorous babble. So inviting was the scene that despite their haste, the boys could not resist the temptation to drop their hooks in promising pools as they moved along. Without half trying, they accumulated a dozen fine trout. The smaller ones they carefully unhooked and threw back into the stream.  They passed through the gap in the mountain and started to cross the bottom to the fire trail. At the brook in the middle of the valley they paused to make one last cast in an especially inviting pool. At that moment two men came out of a near-by thicket. Both were smoking. They were equipped like fishermen, though they had no fish. They were rough looking, with hard faces. One of them had an ugly scar above his right eye and showed a mouthful of gold teeth when he took his cigar from his mouth, as he asked, \"What luck?\"  \"We've got a few,\" replied Charley, extending his creel for their inspection.  The man looked at the fish and swore savagely. \"These kids have fished the brook out,\" he growled. \"There's no use trying this stream. We'll have to go on to the next valley.\"  \"Is that all?\" laughed the ranger, looking much relieved.  \"No, sir, it isn't,\" continued Charley. \"They looked as though they wanted to kill us.\"  The ranger was inclined to smile, but he forbore, seeing that Charley was sensitive. \"You'll soon get used to meeting tough-looking customers in the forest,\" he said.  \"I hope that I don't meet many like that fellow,\" sighed Charley. \"When he scowled at me, he looked as fierce as a chimpanzee. And he had an ugly scar over his eye that actually seemed to turn red.\"  Instantly the ranger's face was sober. \"See here,\" he said seriously. \"What have you been doing? What did you do or say to the men that made them curse you? A little authority hasn't made you toplofty, has it? You know you are not supposed to let anybody know that you're a fire patrol.\"  \"I didn't,\" replied Charley, stung by the implied criticism. \"We caught a few fish in our own valley, then cut through to the valley just below us, on our way to this trail. Just as we reached the run, two men came out of the bushes. They asked what we had caught, and when I showed them, one of them swore at us terribly and said we had fished the stream out so that they would have to go on to the next valley.\"  Charley was in a quandary. These men, with their cigars, were a menace to the forest. It made him nervous merely to look at the glowing tobacco and the careless way the men flicked the ashes about. He was almost panic-stricken at the idea of their passing into his own valley while he was absent. He did not know whether to tell them the truth about his fish or remain silent. But he remembered that his watch in that valley was supposed to be a secret one, and he said nothing. Afterward he was glad that he had remained silent.  \"Come on,\" said the man with the gold teeth. \"These kids have queered us here. We'll be moving.\"  As he started away he gave Charley such a savage look that it almost frightened Charley. It did worry and alarm him, for he could not help asking himself what he should do if he had to deal sternly with such a man. Even with Lew at his side, he felt fearful. Alone in the forest with such desperate-looking men, he knew that he would be helpless.  Then he remembered the automatic stowed in his hip pocket and felt relieved. Now he understood much better why the ranger had given it to him. The remembrance that he had this weapon stiffened his courage wonderfully. He determined that if gun-play ever became necessary, he would not be caught napping. At once he shifted the automatic to his coat pocket, where he could shoot without drawing the weapon, and where he could carry his hand without exciting suspicion.  \"Gee!\" whispered Lew, after the two men had passed out of hearing. \"I wouldn't care to meet that pair after dark.\"  \"What I am afraid of,\" said Charley, \"is that they will set the forest afire. They were mighty careless with their cigars. Will they be any more careful with the butts when they have finished their smoke? I don't know but what we ought to trail them. Yet we've got to meet Mr. Morton and I don't want to be tardy. I can't make up my mind what we ought to do.\"  After a moment's consideration, he unjointed his rod, and started off in the direction from which the men had come. \"We'll find Mr. Morton just as quick as we can,\" he said with decision, \"and tell him the situation. Meantime, we'll make sure those men didn't start any fires up to this point.\"  Charley's anxiety lent wings to his heels and he started at a rate of speed that would soon have winded both boys. At a protest from Lew, he dropped to a fast walk. With open fire trails before them, the chums advanced rapidly. Soon they were well up the slope of the next mountain. They turned and studied the country behind them with anxious eyes. But no smoke columns showed against the green of the forest and they went on with lighter hearts.  \"I'm certainly going to get a pair of good field-glasses,\" said Charley, \"though I don't know where the money's to come from any more than I know how I'll get my battery. But I just have to have both.\"  Their meeting-place with Mr. Morton was in the next valley. Charley glanced at his watch and threw over the switch.  \"Willie might be listening in again to-day,\" suggested Lew. \"It will take him several days to get that new outfit made. We'll try him on the hour.\"  \"Good idea, Lew.\" He looked at his watch. \"It's ten minutes to the hour now. If Willie is listening in, we'll soon know whether or not our aerial will work.\"  They began putting the tent in order, stowing the duffel in neat little piles. Just outside the tent Lew built a foundation for the alcohol stove, by leveling the earth and setting a flat stone for the stove to stand on. Meanwhile, Charley was stuffing the tick with dry leaves.  Exactly on the hour Lew sat down at the wireless key and sent a call flashing into the air. Promptly; his receiver buzzed in response.  \"Got him,\" said Lew, and while Charley went on filling the tick and bringing in hemlock branches to use like springs under the tick, Lew conversed with Willie. The latter was still working at the new wireless set, and had listened in every hour during the day. All the other members of the Wireless Patrol can go along? We'll miss 'em, particularly Roy. And now that he's wireless man on the <i>Lycoming</i>, he'll probably never go on another trip with the Camp Brady Patrol.\"  \"It's too bad for us, but mighty nice for Roy,\" said Charley. \"Just think of being the wireless man on a great ocean steamship when you're only nineteen. He's made for life. Gee! I wish I knew what I am going to do after I graduate from high school.\"  Roy Mercer, like Charley and Lew, was a member of the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol. With his fellows he had taken part in the capture of the German spies who were trying to dynamite the Elk City reservoir and so wreck a great munitions centre during the war; and with three other members of the Wireless Patrol were likewise hard at work, and it was practically certain that by the time the vacation was ended each would have earned his share of the money needed to buy the desired battery.  \"I can't tell you where our camp is,\" rapped out Lew, \"because that is a secret that we are not supposed to tell. The forester does not want anybody to know that Charley is employed by the forestry department. We are posing as fishermen. Tell the fellows not to talk about Charley and tell Charley's father the forester does not want it known for a time that Charley is a fire patrol. He thinks that we have a better chance to find things out if it is not known that we are connected with the forestry department. I will tell him where your camp is and he will inspect it and give you more detailed instructions. But remember that yours is a secret patrol. I would rather that nobody should learn of your presence in the forest. But if you do meet any one, pose as a fisherman. Don't, under any circumstances, let anybody suspect your real purpose.\"  The forester paused a moment, in deep thought. \"Smoke,\" he said at last, \"would betray the location of your camp--at least in the daytime. Don't make any fires unless it be at night. Then be sure they are small, well concealed, and as smokeless as possible. Do your cooking with this.\"  He stepped to a closet and returned with an alcohol stove and a can of fuel, and continued: \"From your spring to the summit of the mountain it is only a short distance. You can get a wide outlook there. Examine the forest carefully in every direction as often as possible. But leave no telltale marks to indicate that the place is a lookout point. And be sure you don't do anything to draw attention to your camp.\"  The forester then swore Charley in as a fire patrol and gave him his badge, with instructions to keep it out of sight.  \"You'll need this, too,\" he said with a smile, handing Charley a portable telephone. \"Your friends can't be at the other end of the wireless all the time, you know.\"  \"Can we fish at all?\" asked Charley. \"I want Lew to have some fun on this trip. He's going to help me a lot with the work.\"  \"Fish as much as you like, as long as it does not interfere with your duty. But remember that your business is to protect the forest. That comes first. You will have to decide how to do it, according to circumstances.\"  The boys carried their duffel to the forester's car. Mr. Marlin telephoned his assistant to look after things during his absence, and in another minute Mr. Marlin and Lew and Charley were whirling along the highway. They reached the point at which they were to enter the forest, jumped to the ground and unloaded their duffel. Mr. Marlin said good-bye, turned his car, and sped back to his office, leaving the two young fire guards alone in the heart of the wilderness.     Chapter X  An Encounter with a Bear    Rapidly the duffel was made into two packs. These were both heavy and bulky.  \"Gee!\" said Lew, as he surveyed the packs, \"I hope we don't meet any state cops. They would arrest us for peddling without licenses.\"  There was small chance, however, of their meeting any one, unless it might be some lone fisherman. On every hand the forest stretched, seemingly interminable.  \"I guess we'd better get our bearings,\" said Charley.  He drew the map from his pocket and spread it on a flat rock. The two boys pored over it for some minutes.  \"We have to cross these two mountains,\" said Lew, \"and camp just the other side of the summit of the third. That's about the same as climbing over three mountains. There are two valleys that we'll have to get across. I judge we'll be just about as far from the road as our old camp was. That's twelve miles or so.\"  \"Gee!\" laughed Charley. \"That means I've got to hike twelve miles over these mountains every time I want to talk to anybody on the telephone. I'm glad Mr. Marlin doesn't care much for talk. The telephone is all right, but compared to the wireless it's like a candle beside an electric light. Mr. Marlin was right when he said the fellows couldn't be listening in for me all the time, but you just bet I'm going to figure out some way to use my wireless. Why, I've got to, if I'm going to make good. This whole neck of the woods could burn up while I'm hiking twelve miles to call help and twelve more to get back to the blaze. And I reckon I'd feel like putting up a stiff fight after hiking twenty-four miles over these mountains. Mr. Marlin is all right, but he isn't quite up to date. He still thinks the wireless is a sort of plaything.\"  \"What you need, Charley, is a battery powerful enough to carry a message from Central City to New York. Just now each lad was engaged in trying to earn money so that the club could buy a battery or dynamo strong enough for this purpose. So each boy was working at any job he could pick up after school, and saving all he earned. Both Charley and Lew had already earned more than their share of the purchase money.  \"You never can tell what will happen,\" said Lew presently. \"Who ever expected Roy to get the job he has? You may land in another just as good. You stand pretty near the head of your class, and everybody knows you're a corking good wireless operator.\"  \"I can tell well enough what will happen, Lew. The minute I'm out of high school, I'll have to go to work with Dad in Miller's factory. Gee! How I hate the place! Think of working nine hours a day in such a dirty, smoky, noisy old hole, where you can't get a breath of fresh air, or see the sky, or hear the birds. Just to think about it is enough to make a fellow feel blue.\"  \"But maybe you won't have to go into the factory at all,\" argued Lew. \"Maybe you can find some other job you like better.\"  \"No, I shall have to go into the factory,\" repeated Charley sadly. \"Dad says I've got to get to work the minute I've graduated, and earn the most money possible. And there's no other place where I can get as much as they pay at Miller's. Dad says I can get two-fifty a day at the start and maybe three dollars.\"  Charley paused and sighed, then added, \"What's three dollars a day if you have to be penned up like an animal to earn it? I'd rather take half as much if I could work out in the open and do something I like.\"  \"Why don't you tell your father so?\"  \"I have--dozens of times. But he says it isn't a question of what I want to do. It's a question of making the most money possible and helping him. He says he's supported me for more than eighteen years and now I have to help him for a year or two anyway.\"  \"That's a shame!\" cried Lew.  \"No, it isn't, Lew,\" explained Charley. \"It's all right about helping Dad, Lew. I want to do that, but I can't bear to think of going to work in that factory.\"  \"It's too bad, Charley. I had hoped so much that we could go to college together.\"  \"Lew, if I could go to college I'd work my head off to do it. You know that. If only I could go to college and learn about the birds and flowers and rocks and trees and animals, I'd be willing to do anything--even to work in Miller's factory for a time. But Dad will need every cent I can earn until I am twenty-one, and I can't see how I can possibly go to college.\"  \"Never mind, Charley. You never can tell what will happen,\" said Lew presently. \"Who ever expected Roy to get the job he has? You may land in another just as good. You stand pretty near the head of your class, and everybody knows you're a corking good wireless operator.\"  \"I can tell well enough what will happen, Lew.

He's been mighty good to me, and he's in the hole now. You see, Dad and Mother have been married twenty years and Dad's worked hard all this time and saved his money to build a house. And just about the time Dad was ready to begin building, prices began to go up. Dad held off, thinking they would drop. But they got higher instead, and finally Dad told the carpenters to go ahead, lest prices should go higher still. Now the house is going to cost almost double what Dad expected it would, and the awful prices of everything else take every cent Dad can earn. With such a big mortgage on the place, Dad says he's just got to have my help or he may lose the house and all he has saved in those twenty years. It's all right about helping Dad.

I had hoped so much that we could go to college together.\"  \"Lew, if I could go to college I'd work my head off to do it. You know that. If only I could go to college and learn about the birds and flowers and rocks and trees and animals, I'd be willing to do anything--even to work in Miller's factory for a time.

He was worse off than you are, for his father died suddenly and Roy had to care for both himself and his mother. And see what came of it. He isn't much older than we are, yet he's got a fine job. Just keep your eyes open and you may pick up something, too.\"  \"It'll have to come quick, then,\" sighed Charley. \"Here it is almost Easter vacation, and I am to graduate in June. This will probably be the last vacation I shall have in a long time.\"  \"Then let's enjoy this vacation. I've been thinking what we could do, and it occurred to me that it would be lots of fun for the Wireless Patrol to make a trip up the river to that old camp of ours. It won't be too cold to camp out if we take out our tents and our little collapsible stoves. Suckers ought to be running good and we can catch a fine mess of fish, take a hike or two, and have a bully trip up the river and back. Let's go tell the rest of the fellows.\"  Lew jumped up and started for the door. Then he stopped suddenly and a look of disappointment came over his face. \"I'll bet none of 'em can go,\" he said. \"They've all got jobs for the vacation. I'm glad we've got our money earned.\"  \"I just thought of another difficulty,\" sighed Charley. \"Not one of us owns a boat.\"  \"We can borrow one,\" said Lew.  \"I hate to borrow things,\" replied Charley. \"You remember how I borrowed old man Packer's bob-sled and broke it and then had to pay to have it remade. No more borrowing for me.\"  \"Why can't we make a boat? There's plenty of time between now and vacation. If we do the work ourselves, it oughtn't to cost more than two or three dollars and then we'd have a boat of our own.\"  \"Bully!\" cried Charley. \"We can make it as good as anybody. We'll do it.\"  \"All right. I'll go down-town and find the price of oars and rowlocks, and you go over to Hank Cooley's and find out how his father made that boat of his. It's a dandy and just what we need.\"  The two boys rushed off in opposite directions, each full of enthusiasm over the plan to build a new boat and make a trip up the river during their Easter vacation.     Chapter II  What Came of Them    A few hours later Charley Russell again sat before the bench in the little wireless house in his father's yard. Before him lay some patterns for a rowboat, and on a piece of paper Charley was trying to figure out how much lumber it would take to build the boat.  \"We'll need two sixteen-foot boards, each a foot wide for the sides,\" he said, looking across the table at his chum, who sat ready, with pencil and paper, to jot down the figures Charley gave him.  \"Thirty-two feet,\" said Lew, setting down the number on his paper.  Charley bent over his patterns, measuring and estimating in silence. \"It'll take three more like 'em for the bottom,\" he said presently.  \"That's forty-eight more,\" replied Lew, jotting down the number.  \"And these cross braces,\" added Charley, after another period of calculation, \"will take ten feet more.\"  Again Lew set down the number.  \"That provides for everything but the decks,\" said Charley. \"They will take seven or eight feet more. Better call it ten. That's all. What does it make?\"  Lew put down ten and added the column of figures. \"One hundred feet exactly,\" he said.  \"Bully good!\" replied Charley. \"A hundred feet oughtn't to cost much of anything. The rub's going to be to get the oars. You say they want five dollars for the cheapest pair at the hardware store, and the sporting goods store wants six-fifty.\"  \"The robbers!\" cried Lew. \"Think of it. Six-fifty for about fifteen cents' worth of wood. Maybe we can get a pair of second-hand oars somewhere. Six-fifty is as much as we can afford to spend on the whole outfit.\"  \"It will be all right to get second-hand oars,\" said Charley, \"for we can get new ones later, when we have the money. Besides, we want to put most of our money into the boat itself. As long as we are going to build it, we want to make it the very best boat possible. We want the best wood in the market and we want our boat light enough so that the two of us can carry it. I reckon it may cost two or three dollars if we buy such good wood as that. But it will be worth while. We can get along with cheap oars for a time. Let's go down to the lumber-yard and get our boards.\"  The two chums left the shop and hurried down the street toward the lumber-yard.  \"If we can get our lumber to-day,\" said Charley, \"I'm certain we can get our boat made before the spring vacation. We ought to be able to put in three hours apiece every afternoon after high school lets out, and we can get in another hour apiece before school, if we get up early enough. That's four hours apiece, or eight hours a day. We certainly ought to get it finished and painted inside of ten days.\"  \"Sure,\" replied Lew. \"We'll have her done all right. And we'll have just about the finest boat in town.\"  \"And I reckon we'll have just about the finest boat in town.\"  \"And I reckon we'll have just about the finest trip ever,\" went on Charley. \"If we start right after school closes for the Easter vacation we can row up-stream that afternoon as far as Hillman's Grove, and camp there for the night. That will give us almost half a day's extra time. Then we can reach our old camping ground the next day and get the tent up and our wood cut and maybe even catch some fish before dark. We'll have everything ready so we can jump right into the boat and pull out the minute school is over.\"  \"Sure,\" assented Lew. Then, after a moment's pause, he added, \"Ain't it a shame none of the other members of the Wireless Patrol can go along? We'll miss 'em, particularly Roy. And now that he's wireless man on the <i>Lycoming</i>, he'll probably never go on another trip with the Camp Brady Patrol.\"  \"It's too bad for us, but mighty nice for Roy,\" said Charley. \"Just think of being the wireless man on a big ocean steamer when you're only nineteen. I wish I knew what I am going to do.\"  \"I know how you feel, Charley. Maybe something will turn up so that you won't need to go into the factory after all. But here we are at the lumber-yard. Let's get the boards and begin our boat at once. We'll have a good time this vacation, no matter what happens afterward.\"  \"Well, boys, what can I do for you?\" inquired the lumber dealer, as Charley and Lew approached him.  \"We want one hundred feet of the lightest and best boards you have,\" replied Charley. \"We are going to build a boat and we want it to be strong but light, so that the two of us can handle it.\"  \"White pine would be just the thing for you,\" replied the dealer, \"but I haven't a foot of it in the place and can't get any. I have some fine cedar boards that would make a good light boat. Just come over to this pile of lumber.\" And he led the way across the yard.  \"That will suit us all right if it's wide enough,\" said Charley. \"We want foot boards.\"  \"Well, that's what these are. And a good inch thick, too. They're mighty good boards. Hardly a knot in 'em. We don't see much lumber like that nowadays.\"  \"They'll do all right,\" assented Charley, after examining the boards. \"What do they cost a hundred?\"  \"Ten dollars.\"  \"Ten dollars!\" cried Charley in consternation. Then a smile came on his face. \"Quit your kidding,\" he said. \"What <i>do</i> they come at?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the man. His voice was sharp and a frown had gathered on his forehead. \"Ten dollars, and cheap at that.\"  Charley turned to his companion with a look of dismay. \"We can never build our boat with wood at such a price,\" he cried. \"With five dollars to pay for oars, and two dollars for paint, and some more for nails and rowlocks, and lock and chain, the boat would cost eighteen or twenty dollars just for the materials. That's three times as much as we have got.\"  After an instant the look on Charley's face changed to one of intense indignation. He had a quick temper, and now he turned to the lumber dealer in anger.  \"I guess the sugar profiteers are not the only ones who ought to be in the penitentiary,\" he said hotly. \"You can keep your old boards. And I hope they rot for you.\"  Then he turned on his heel and started toward the gate, followed by Lew.  \"Come back here!\"  The words rang out sharp and sudden. The voice was commanding and compelling. Involuntarily the two boys turned back. The lumber dealer stood before them, his face ablaze with indignation. Under his fiery glances the boys were speechless. For a moment the man said nothing. Evidently he was struggling with his temper. When he had gotten control of himself he spoke. His voice was deep and low, but harsh and cutting.  \"Before you make a fool of yourself again, young man,\" he said, speaking directly to Charley, \"you had better know what you are talking about. You called me a profiteer for asking $100 a thousand feet for those cedar boards. Young man, those boards cost me $90 a thousand in the cars at the station. That leaves me a margin of $10 a thousand for handling them. Out of that I have to pay to have the boards hauled from the station, pay for insurance on them, pay their proportionate share of overhead expense, and pay for hauling them to customers. How much of that $10 do you think is left for profit? So little it almost requires a microscope to see it. I have to handle a good many hundred feet of lumber to make as much as the cheapest sort of laborer gets for a day's pay. The fact is, young man, that far from profiteering on that lumber, I am selling it at a smaller profit than I ever sold any lumber before in my life. Some lumber I am handling at a loss. But in these critical days, with factories closing everywhere, and men by the thousands being thrown out of work, the best thing a man can do, either for himself or for his country, is to keep business moving. That's why I am selling lumber without profit.\"  Charley was suddenly abashed. He held out his hand and responded to the Commissioner's greeting, but was at a joss for anything further to say. He thought of his toast and coffee and was more than ever embarrassed, because he had only three slices to offer. Nevertheless, he set what he had before his guests.  \"I'm awfully sorry this is all I can offer you,\" he said, \"but I had some visitors yesterday who cleaned me out of food.\"  \"So I have heard,\" replied the Chief Forester, with a smile.  \"You will be glad to know, Charley,\" said the forester, \"I've been as blind as a bat. I never liked Lumley, any more than you did, though I couldn't tell you that. But I trusted him because he had been in the department a good many years and was fairly efficient. He has betrayed my trust and attempted to rob the state by false measurement. I understand now why my estimate seemed so far out of the way. The estimate was probably close enough. Lumley has sold out to the lumber operators. I'd like to know how they reached him.\"  The forester fell into a deep study. His face was dark and angry. A long time he sat silent. \"I wonder,\" he said finally, \"if Bill Collins' presence in the woods last spring had anything to do with it. I'd just like to know who that was with him.\"  \"Oh! Mr. Marlin,\" cried Charley, \"you don't mean----\"  \"Yes, I do. Your service as a fire patrol ends to-night. To-morrow you take charge of this section as temporary ranger, pending Jim Morton's recovery. I just can't get along without a ranger in this district. Work is being neglected, the big lumber operation has already commenced in Lumley's district, and things are piling up here too deep. I can't get along another day without a new ranger.\"  Charley was too happy for words. \"I'll do my best,\" he said, with quavering tones. But in a moment he got command of himself. \"You told me I couldn't handle a crew of men,\" he said.  \"Maybe you can't, Charley, but you've handled everything else and handled it well. It is plain that you love the forest and understand as much about its needs as any ranger I have. A little experience is all you need to make a first-class ranger. I'll give the men a talking to. When I get done, they'll know it won't pay to monkey with you, even if you are only a high school boy. Now, Ranger Russell, I think we had better turn in and get some sleep, for we'll have to pull foot early to-morrow.\"     Chapter XXI  A Trouble Maker    Pull foot early they did, too. Charley himself was no sluggard, but the forester's capacity for work simply amazed him. He knew the forester was on the job late every night, for he reported to him each night the last thing before he went to bed. Yet whenever the forester spent the night with Charley, Mr. Marlin was up at an early hour; and the present occasion proved no exception.  Mr. Marlin had never said much about himself to Charley, and no one else had happened to do so; but Mr. Marlin had worked himself up from the ranks. He had been a fire patrol and later a ranger, and then had attended the state forestry school, as the other district foresters had done.  His unusual training, great diligence, intelligence, and untiring energy had made him one of the ablest men in the service. By sheer ability he had won for himself the oversight of this district, which was one of the most important in the entire million acres of state forest lands.  Hardly was the forester afoot this morning before he had a fire going and breakfast cooking. Before breakfast was ready, the two forest guardians began to strike camp. Charley took down his wireless and stowed it as compactly as possible. The tent was lowered and rolled up. Everything was gotten into portable shape, and as soon as breakfast was over, the dishes were washed and they, too, were added to the bundles.  \"I don't care to let anybody know where your camp was,\" said the forester. \"I may want to use this site again. So we'll have to pack our stuff out ourselves, at least part of the way. I am going to put a crew of men in here to-morrow and they can finish carrying out the duffel if we cave in before we reach the road. It will be a pretty good load.\"  Each of them strapped a big pack to his back. The rifle and the fishing-rod had been fastened to the battery, which in turn was roped to poles for handles. In this way it was possible for the two to carry all Charley's outfit. By sun-up the two were already on the trail. They toiled up the slope and crossed the ridge close to Charley's watch-tower. The way was rough and the going hard. But once they struck a fire trail, the path was easy. Yet at best it was a hard and toilsome hike, and several hours elapsed before they reached the forester's motor-car, which he had concealed in the pines. Both of them were tired, and Charley felt as though his arms were about ready to part from his shoulders.  Most of their journey had been made in silence. But now that they were seated comfortably in a motor-car, they once more began to talk.  \"I had to bring you in from the forest, Charley,\" explained Mr. Marlin, \"because as a ranger it will be necessary for you often to be at headquarters. I have arranged for you to live with Ranger Lumley. His district adjoins yours, and his house, right in the forest, is near the dividing line. So it will be about as convenient for you as it is for him. He is to be at the office to meet us and look after you. We'll pick him up and go on to his house with your things.\"  Ranger Lumley was on hand as the forester had said he would be. Charley had found Ranger Morton and his wife so likable that he was glad indeed of the opportunity to become acquainted with this second ranger. But the minute he laid eyes on him, he felt a chill of disappointment. Yet he could not have told exactly why. Somewhere, too, he felt sure, he had seen the man before; though he could not remember when or where.  Lumley was a man small of stature, with a hooked nose, fishy blue eyes, a thin, hard mouth, and a face seamed and wrinkled. Yet he was quite evidently not an old man. Charley had noticed that some of the tough characters in his home town looked like that, and the more he studied Ranger Lumley's face, the less he liked the man. Particularly did he dislike his eye. Once he caught the ranger looking at him slyly, and the gleam in the ranger's eye reminded Charley of the vicious look of a horse when he shows the white of his eye. It seemed to Charley, too, as though there was something suggestive of craftiness and cunning in the man's countenance.  When they reached the Lumley home, Charley felt his dislike for the man increasing. Unlike the neat and attractive dwelling of the Mortons, the Lumley house was dirty and disorderly. The children were unclean and ragged. They had no manners whatever. Yet they obeyed readily enough when their father spoke to them. But it did not take Charley long to discover that they obeyed because of fear. When he realized that, he thought of the vicious look he had noted in the ranger's eye. There were dogs innumerable about the place, and they all slunk away when their master approached. Yet all the time, as he showed Charley about, the ranger was almost obsequious. This evident contradiction between the man's actions and his looks made Charley distrust him immediately, and it was with heavy heart that he said good-bye to Mr. Marlin and watched him drive away.  The ranger showed Charley to the room that was to be his. Charley began to carry his luggage up-stairs. He would much rather have taken it all himself, but the ranger insisted upon helping him. When Charley saw how the man eyed every package and scrutinized every article, he understood quickly enough that Lumley wanted to help him, not because of any wish to be courteous, but simply because of his burning curiosity. Especially was the ranger curious about Charley's wireless outfit, but Charley volunteered no information.  The more Charley considered his situation, the gloomier he felt concerning it. He had looked forward to his coming, after Mr. Marlin had told him of the arrangement, with a feeling of pleasant anticipation. Charley was not the least bit shy and made friends readily. He had a feeling that all the men in the Forest Service must be pretty fine men and that their interest in their work would make them, like Mr. Marlin and Mr. Morton, eager to help a recruit. Thus Charley had believed that Lumley would be very helpful to him. He had intended to put himself more or less in Lumley's hands and trust to the ranger for guidance. But a very few minutes spent with Lumley made Charley feel that he could not take the man into his confidence. He almost felt as though he dared not, though when he came to consider the matter fully, that attitude seemed foolish. Lumley was a guardian of the forest as well as himself, and surely he could trust him with matters that pertained to the forest.  Charley tried to fight down this feeling of distrust. It seemed to him very wrong to accept a man's hospitality, even if he was to pay well for it, and at the same time be suspicious of the man. But hardly had he decided that he ought to be frank with his fellow ranger when Lumley began asking questions that caused the feeling of distrust to return with renewed force. Lumley's questions were intended to seem innocent enough; but Charley was sharper than he perhaps looked, and he saw the real intent behind the questions. The man was slyly trying to find out all he could about Charley's history, and particularly how much Charley had been paid as a fire patrol and what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.

Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger, for he had never once thought about the matter, nor had Mr. Marlin mentioned it. But when Charley told Lumley so, he could see that the ranger did not believe him.  When the ranger began to question Charley about his recent work in the woods, Charley answered him evasively. Lumley knew that Charley had been acting as fire patrol, because Mr. Marlin had told him so. But Charley felt very sure he did not know where the secret camp had been pitched, for Mr. Marlin had distinctly said that matter was a secret between Charley and himself. So Charley answered him evasively. Lumley knew that Charley had been acting as fire patrol, because Mr. Marlin had told him so. But Charley felt very sure he did not know where the secret camp had been pitched, for Mr. Marlin had distinctly said that matter was a secret between Charley and himself.

But Charley felt very sure he did not know where the secret camp had been pitched, for Mr. Marlin had distinctly said that matter was a secret between Charley and himself. So Charley answered him evasively and soon turned the conversation to other matters.  While Charley was arranging his duffel, two or three dirty youngsters came bouncing into the room and at once began to drag Charley's wireless apparatus from the pasteboard box. With a cry Charley sprang toward them and snatched the instruments out of their hands. The ranger gave a savage oath and aimed a kick at the lads, but they dodged and ran from the room.  At first Charley was terribly annoyed. But in a second he was glad the incident had happened. Nothing had been injured and he had had a warning of what might be expected. It gave him a good opportunity to shut up his things without seeming to be suspicious of his host. Charley acted at once.  \"I have no need of this wireless outfit at present,\" he said, \"and if you have a spare box and some nails, I will just nail these things up until I have time to set up the outfit.\" So the wireless instruments were quickly uncoupled and stowed away in a bag, and the aerial taken down and loosely rolled around the spreaders so that it could be hoisted in a moment's time. Then the little party set off swiftly down the valley toward the point at which the eagle had come to earth. When they thought they were near the place they began to search the ground carefully for some signs of the tragedy that had occurred. They looked in vain. Nowhere could they find any telltale marks.  \"I suspect it must have been a coon,\" suggested Charley. \"It looked like it to me. We know there are lots of them in this forest.\"  Just then the excited chattering of squirrels attracted them. They began to examine the trees about them. Presently they came to one around which were scattered innumerable shells of nuts that had been gnawed into and eaten.  \"There must be squirrels in that tree,\" said Lew.  Now muffled squeaks of fear or pain were audible. The two boys looked at each other in dismay.  \"You don't suppose the entire stream is like that, do you, Lew?\" asked Charley. \"There won't be a trout in it if it is.\" Then, after a pause, he added: \"What in the world do you suppose has become of the trout, anyway?\"  His question was soon answered, at least in part. Continuing along the bank of the run, the boys presently came to one of the deepest pools in the stream. In the crystal water they could see many trout, for there were no hiding-places in the pool at this low stage of water. Some of the fish were large. At the approach of the boys the frightened trout darted frantically about in the pool, vainly seeking cover.  Around the margins of this pool were innumerable little tracks in the earth. \"Raccoons!\" exclaimed Lew. \"There must have been dozens of them here.\"  But not until he found some little piles of fish-bones near the farther end of the pool did he grasp the significance of the tracks. He stopped in amazement.  \"Look here, Charley,\" he called, pointing to the piles of fish-bones. \"Those coons have been catching and eating trout.\" Then, after a moment's thought, he added, \"If this stream is like this in April, what will it be in August? There will be hardly a drop of water or a trout left. Why, this brook is ruined for years as a trout-stream--maybe forever. And it used to be absolutely the finest trout-stream in this part of the mountains.\"  Depressed and silent, the two lads continued along the brook. The mountains on either side of them and the entire bottom between lay black and desolate. But far up the run they could now see green foliage again, where the fire had been stopped.  \"Let's go on to those pines before we eat our breakfast,\" said Charley. \"It would make me sick to eat here in these ruins.\"  \"That's exactly the way I feel, too,\" replied Lew. \"It is the most awful thing I ever saw. Let's get out of it.\"  As rapidly as they could, they forced their way up-stream. The valley became narrower as they advanced. It was shaped like a huge wish-bone; and they were nearing the small end, where the mountains came together and formed a high knob. As the valley narrowed, the grade became much steeper, and their progress was correspondingly slower.  The pines they were heading for stood almost at the top of the knob at the crotch of the wish-bone. They were, therefore, at a considerable elevation. From the edge of these pines one would have to travel only a short distance to reach the very summit of the knob. After a hard walk the boys reached the end of the burned tract. They penetrated into the living forest far enough to shut out the sight of the dead forest they had just traversed. Then they threw down their packs and hastily set about cooking their breakfast.  \"Gee!\" cried Lew. \"I never was so glad to get away from anything in my life. I hope I shall never again see a sight like that. It fairly makes a fellow sick.\"  In their haste to start cooking, they were not as careful as they might have been in building their fire, and they made considerable smoke. Before they were half done eating, a man appeared farther up the run, advancing through the pines at great speed. He seemed to be in a big hurry until he caught sight of the two boys as they sat on the dry pine-needles. After that he came forward at an ordinary gait.  \"Good-morning, boys,\" he said pleasantly, as he drew near. Then, catching sight of their rods, he added, \"If you came to get fish, you struck a mighty poor place.\"  \"It used to be the best place for trout I ever saw,\" replied Lew. \"This brook used to be full of 'em--big ones, too. But the season has been so dry, the brook has almost disappeared.\"  \"You mean that the fires that have swept this valley have burned it up,\" replied the stranger.  \"It's too awful a thing to joke about,\" replied Lew.  \"A joke!\" exclaimed the stranger, frowning.  \"It's the literal truth--and a most terrible truth, at that.\"  \"I don't understand,\" said Lew, slowly. \"How can fire burn water? I supposed the lack of snow last winter and of rain this spring had made the brook shrink.\"  \"Not for a minute, young man, not for a minute. If fires hadn't swept this valley the past two or three years, there would have been plenty of water in the run, rain or no rain.\"  \"I--I don't exactly understand,\" said Charley.  \"I mean,\" replied the forester, \"that no matter whether Jim gets well in time or not, you are going to handle the lumber operation in his own district entirely alone, just as a full-fledged ranger would do. It was both a high compliment to Charley and a fine reward, for the timber operation was large, involving great sums of money, and even with the most careful supervision the state might easily be defrauded of thousands of dollars.  But Mr. Marlin was far too wise to put Charley in such a position without adequate training. Personally, therefore, he began to prepare him for the work. Accompanied by Charley, he went entirely over the operations in Lumley's territory. He carried a duplicate of the contract under which the wood was being cut. Together they discussed every phase of the contract, and the forester showed Charley how each step in the operation should be carried out; how the trees should be selected and marked, how they should be felled and trimmed, how the brush should be disposed of, and finally how the timber should be scaled at the skidways along the highway, whence the timber was being carted away in huge trucks.  Then he went with Charley into the latter's own district and started him at the task of selecting and marking the trees for cutting. These had to be greater than ten inches in diameter, breast-high, and had to be marked. Crooked trees and wolf trees whose unduly large tops harmed lower growths were also to be cut. The trees were marked by blazing them at the butt and breast-high and striking the blazes with a heavy hammer that left the imprint of the state's marker on the wood. Merely to select and mark all the trees to be cut was a considerable task, but Charley tried to do this and carry on his other work as well. It meant that he worked from the earliest possible moment in the morning until he could no longer see at night. Day after day he worked at his tasks, content to eat cold meals that Mrs. Lumley packed for him, and reaching home so weary that he tumbled into bed and was asleep the instant he had telephoned his daily report to his chief.  Darkness had already fallen, one night, when Charley drew near the Lumley habitation. To his surprise he saw a light up-stairs in Lumley's room. As he drew nearer, he could faintly discern the forms of two men in the chamber. Involuntarily he stopped to scrutinize the figures. At the same instant Lumley's dogs began to bark, as they always did when any one approached. Quick as a flash the curtain of the chamber window was pulled down. But in that brief instant Charley was sure he recognized the man with Lumley. It was Bill Collins.  Charley was startled completely out of his weariness. A moment later he got a second shock. Like a flash it came to him where he had first seen Lumley. He had been with Collins the day the latter had appeared in the forest. Collins had attracted Charley's attention so strongly that he had hardly noticed Collins' companion. Yet now he was certain he was right. He was certain that he was not mistaken.  From the beginning he had believed that he had seen Lumley somewhere before the forester introduced Lumley to him. Now it came to him where he had first seen Lumley. Lumley was the man he and Lew had seen with Bill Collins.  Still another surprise awaited Charley. When he entered the house Lumley was seated at the table opposite a stranger, and the stranger was not Bill Collins. But he resembled Collins so much that Charley did not wonder that, at such a distance, he had made the mistake of thinking the man was Collins.     Chapter XXIII  A Startling Discovery    Charley was glad enough that the man was not Collins. Had he been Collins, Charley would have had another matter to worry about. He was carrying such a load of responsibility these days that he sometimes felt that he couldn't stand another thing; and in moments of depression he thought he could not continue to carry the load he already had.  For Charley was learning the lesson that every man in authority learns: when the forester laid out a piece of work for him, the forester expected him to get it done. No matter what the difficulties were, Charley had to find a way to surmount them. Many and many a day he would gladly have exchanged places with the humblest laborers in his crew.  All that was required of them was merely to do what they were told to do, hour after hour or day after day. There was no need for them to lie awake wrestling with problems that seemed impossible of solution, as Charley had more than once lain awake.  For it had not all been smooth sailing for Charley, any more than it is for any man in authority. After his first set-to with the surly laborer, he had not had any open trouble with his men. But more than one of his crew did not always do an honest day's work, and any failure on the men's part put Charley behind with the amount of work he was expected to get done. This difficulty Charley had finally remedied by asking for Mr. Morton's help. The latter had sent for several of the laborers and had shown them that in hindering Charley they were hurting the Forest Service and thus, in the long run, harming themselves.  Furthermore, as the days passed, and Charley showed that he knew his job, that he was just to everybody, that he had control of his temper, that he expected a fair day's work every day, while he himself accomplished more actual work each day than any man in his gang, the attitude of the men under him changed. Before the summer ended, Charley had as loyal a crew as any man could ask for. And to their loyalty they began to add ambition. For Charley was able gradually to instil into them the spirit which made them want to do as much as any other crew and a little bit more.  So his road making came on apace. Rapidly the rude highway advanced through the forest. Every day after his crew had gone home, Charley went over the area to be made the succeeding day, examining carefully every inch of the ground and determining how he would meet each little problem that would come up. Thus prepared, he speedily acquired a reputation for unusual ability. The result was that his men, when stopped by some obstacle, at once came to him for assistance, though at first they would have scorned to ask a \"high school boy\" for enlightenment about any task in the forest.  The road under construction was being pushed straight through the heart of the big timber. It was to lead directly to the foot of the mountain on the top of which Charley and Lew had had their secret watch tree. Materials for a real fire-tower, a sixty-foot structure of steel, had been purchased, and as soon as the road was completed, this material was to be trucked to the foot of the mountain, and the tower itself erected on the summit, close to the very tree that Charley and Lew had climbed so often.  The erection of the tower was another task for which Charley would be responsible. Long before the road was completed, Charley had cement carried in as far as the trucks could travel. Then the cement was carried up the mountain by laborers. It had been put in small sacks so that it could be handled easily. Sand was already at hand, and water could be had at the run coming from the spring by which Charley had camped. Tools and boards were brought, the proper excavations made, forms fashioned and fitted into the excavations, and then cement was mixed and poured into the forms to make the foundation to which the tower was to be bolted. By the time the road was finished so that the steel framework could be trucked in, the cement foundations were hard as stone and ready for the instant erection of the tower.  At once the steel frame began to ascend. Upright was added to upright, cross brace bolted to cross brace, and rung after rung added to the steel ladder that led up to what was to be the watch-tower. In a surprisingly short time the steel work was completed. Now the forester brought in skilled carpenters and the wood for the tower room was cut after the patterns and the cut pieces hoisted up to the top of the steel frame where the watch-tower itself began to take shape.  While these operations were afoot, Charley and his laborers were back in the forest, running a telephone-line along the new road. Holes had to be dug, poles cut, barked, hauled, and set up, and the wires strung. While his men set the poles, Charley himself, with a helper, strung the wires. At this job he needed no instruction. His experiences with the wireless were now of great value to him, for he understood about insulation, grounding, short circuits, and the like as well as any skilled lineman.  So the telephone-line came on apace, and long before the tower was finished, Charley had the line complete from the highway, where it joined the main line, to the summit of the hill where the tower was going up. He installed an instrument in a waterproof box nailed to a tree, so that he could now talk from the hilltop to the forester's office. When the tower was finally completed, he ran the lines up inside the angle-irons to protect them from the terrific winds, so that the tower man could remain at his post twenty-four hours a day throughout the fire season. The materials for the cabin would be trucked in along the new road and carried up the mountain, and some of them would be cut right on the spot; for the forester planned to erect a neat log cabin.  Before the road was completed, therefore, Charley and the forester went over every step in the process of construction, and decided how to do each task, from the making of the concrete foundations to the stringing of the telephone wires when the tower was complete. The tower itself was to be a slender steel structure made of angle-iron supports bolted together, with a little square room at the top for the watcher. This room would be enclosed on every side with glass windows, and from this great elevation a watcher could see in every direction over miles and miles of forest. A telephone would connect with the forester's office.  At the foot of this tower Mr. Marlin intended to build a snug, little cabin, so that the tower man could remain at his post twenty-four hours a day throughout the fire season. The materials for the cabin would be trucked in along the new road and carried up the mountain, and some of them would be cut right on the spot; for the forester planned to erect a neat log cabin.

This room would be enclosed on every side with glass windows, and from this great elevation a watcher could see in every direction over miles and miles of forest. A telephone would connect with the forester's office.  At the foot of this tower Mr. Marlin intended to build a snug, little cabin, so that the tower man could remain at his post twenty-four hours a day throughout the fire season. The materials for the cabin would be trucked in along the new road and carried up the mountain, and some of them would be cut right on the spot; for the forester planned to erect a neat log cabin.  Before the road was completed, therefore, Charley and the forester went over every step in the process of construction, and decided how to do each task, from the making of the concrete foundations to the stringing of the telephone wires when the tower was complete. The tower itself was to be a slender steel structure made of angle-iron supports bolted together, with a little square room at the top for the watcher. This room would be enclosed on every side with glass windows, and from this great elevation a watcher could see in every direction over miles and miles of forest. A telephone would connect with the forester's office.  At the foot of this tower Mr. Marlin intended to build a snug, little cabin, so that the tower man could instantly communicate with the forester at Oakdale.  Now the cabin went up. Large, flat stones were assembled and a rough but stable foundation made below the level of the ground. Trees were felled, barked, squared on two sides, and properly notched at the corners. When a sufficient number had been prepared, the frame of the cabin was erected, log being laid upon log, with the corners dovetailing. Wooden pins held the logs in place. Windows and a door were cut out and framed. Then the rafters for the roof were fashioned, the sheathing nailed on, and shingles, made at a former lumber operation in Mr. Marlin's own territory, completed the job. A fireplace was made of big stones and concrete, and the cabin was about complete. A telephone extension was run into the building. At any time now a fire patrol could take up his twenty-four-hour watch at the fire-tower.  The early rush of fishermen was past; but the fine weather still brought hosts of them into the woods, and the danger of fire increased rather than lessened. The scanty rainfall in spring had left the woods still dry, and now but few showers came. Fire patrols were still difficult to obtain, however, and Charley decided that he would go to the forester's office and talk over his work. He had three miles to walk, and although he had already trudged several times that distance, heavily loaded, he did not hesitate for a moment. When Lumley suggested that he use the telephone and avoid the walk, Charley merely smiled.  \"I don't mind it,\" he said.  \"I'd like to see myself walk that distance for any such fool errand,\" growled the ranger.  When Charley had said he didn't mind the walk he had told the truth. Yet he had understated it. The fact was that he hugely enjoyed the walk. He was rested from his long carry, and with nothing to weight him down, his feet felt light as feathers. He trudged briskly along the smooth highway, every sense alive to the delights of the forest. All about him the woods were vocal with the calls of birds. The wind whispered and sighed in the pine tops. And sometimes, when the air in the bottom was still as sluggish water, Charley could hear the wind roaring among the trees far up on the hillsides. The scent of spring was in the air--that indescribable mixture of the smell of opening buds and flowers and green things and rank steaming earth, that together make such an intoxicating odor. And all about him Charley caught glimpses of the wild life of the forest.  It was late in the day when he reached the forester's office. The forester seemed greatly surprised to see him.  \"I came to talk to you about my work,\" explained Charley.  The forester frowned. \"What is the telephone for?\" he asked a bit brusquely.  \"I didn't want to talk over my business before that man,\" protested Charley.  The forester looked at him searchingly. \"Why do you want to be a fire patrol?\" he asked.  \"I've got to go to work at something,\" said Charley, \"and I'd love to help care for the forest. You see, I'm almost through high school and I've got to go to work and help Dad the minute I've graduated. He wants me to go into the factory with him. I hate factories. But I love the woods. You'd never be sorry, if you hired me, sir.\"  \"Are you sure it isn't work rather than the factory you dislike?\" demanded the forester bluntly.  \"No, no!\" protested Charley. \"I'd work day and night gladly if I could do what I want to do. And there's nothing I can think of I'd rather do than help take care of the forest.\"  \"Very good,\" said the forester, \"but I need patrols now, not after school closes in June.\"  \"Maybe I could get excused for the rest of the term,\" pleaded Charley.  \"And throw away your chance to graduate? I don't think I want that kind of a boy for a fire patrol,\" said the forester with a frown. \"You might decide to quit this job, too, about the time we stacked up against a hot fire.\"  Lew spoke up. \"You don't understand what Charley means, sir,\" he explained. \"Charley is away ahead of most of us in his school work. He's done enough now to give him his diploma.\"  \"Indeed!\" replied the forester.  Then he turned to Charley in apology. \"I beg your pardon, young man. I misjudged you. I should like to have such an exemplary young man for a patrol, but you are too young. We practically never employ a man not yet of age as a fire patrol. A boy would have to have very unusual qualifications if we did take him. I'm sorry, my lad. I believe you are a fine boy, and I'd like to hire you. But you are too young.\"  Charley turned his head away to hide the tears that he could not keep back as he saw the opportunity slipping away from him. Then he dashed his hand across his eyes and faced the forester. \"It's some consolation to know that that beast paid for this, and paid well. I'm sure glad he's dead. It's a good thing for the forest.\"  \"Yes, that's a good job done,\" replied the forester, \"and a nice skin and a bounty for you. That ought to be some consolation to you. But I'm mighty sorry about the pup. Whenever you can, get rid of those fellows. How many young deer or other harmless animals do you suppose this fellow would have slaughtered before another spring?\"  Making sure that the cat was really dead, the forester opened the trap.  Then he picked up the dead cat and led the way back to the tent. \"I'll show you how to skin this fellow,\" he said, and, taking out his knife, began to remove the hide.  \"Gee!\" exclaimed Charley. \"Wouldn't the fellows like to know about this?\" He looked at his watch. \"Some of them will surely be listening in,\" he said.  Then he sat down beside his key, and while he watched the forester skin the wildcat, he kept his spark-gap snapping and cracking with the fat sparks from the new battery. He was calling Lew. He got no answer and flashed out the signal for the Wireless Patrol and promptly got a reply from Henry. Through Henry he made his nightly report to the forester, and through the forester sent his congratulations to Mrs. Morton on the success of her initial attempt at radio communication, and inquired after the sick ranger. So both Charley and his new friend were happy that night.  It was quite evident to Charley, when he called Mrs. Morton on the following night, that she must have spent much of the day practicing at her key; for the certainty and assurance with which she transmitted her brief message this time could have come only from hours of practice. Now, in addition to acknowledging Charley's call, she added the simple message, \"Jim is improving.\" Charley did not guess that she had practiced that short message for an hour. Even if he had, he would have been none the less pleased; for practice was the very thing needed to make her an efficient operator. By the time three weeks had elapsed, Mrs. Morton could communicate with Charley readily. Also her husband was improving every day, though it would still be weeks before he could resume his duties. Altogether, Charley's cup of happiness seemed full to overflowing.  There was still more happiness in store for him, however,--a happiness he had not dared to hope for. One day Mr. Marlin appeared at Charley's camp just at dusk. Charley was about to cook his supper. At once he doubled the portions of food to be cooked, and while he worked over his fire, he reported to his superior on the condition of the forest under his charge. By this time Charley knew every inch of it intimately. He had just completed an inspection, lasting several days, of the entire area. He was enthusiastic about his work and full of plans for the future. Practically all his suggestions were good, and the forester smiled and smiled with approval, as he sat back in the shadow, listening.  When Charley had completed his statement, the forester said, \"Charley, your report is very satisfactory, and I am especially pleased with the way you comprehend the needs of the situation and plan for improvements. I approve of practically all your suggestions. How would you like to go ahead and work them out?\"  \"They ought to be done,\" said Charley impetuously. Then he stopped. \"I mean,\" he corrected himself, \"that it seems to me they ought to be. But to do most of them would require a ranger with a crew of men.\"  \"But you haven't answered my question,\" said the forester with a kindly smile.  Charley looked puzzled. \"I told you I think that they ought to be done.\"  \"Still you haven't answered my question,\" said the forester with a kindly smile.  Charley looked puzzled. \"I told you I think that they ought to be done.\"  \"Still you haven't answered my question.\"  Charley stopped a moment to try to recall exactly what the forester had said. Then he went on. \"Of course, I should like to work them out, for they ought to be done. But I also told you it would need a ranger and a crew of men. I <i>couldn't</i> do all those things alone.\"  The forester began to laugh. \"Charley,\" he said fondly, \"the Bible tells us there are none so blind as those who won't see. If you were the ranger in charge of those men, would you still like to do the work?\"  \"Oh! Mr. Marlin,\" cried Charley, \"you don't mean----\"  \"Yes, I do. Your service as a fire patrol ends to-night. To-morrow you take charge of this section as temporary ranger, pending Jim Morton's recovery. I just can't get along without a ranger in this district. Work is being neglected, the big lumber operation has already commenced in Lumley's district, and things are piling up here too deep. I can't get along another day without a new ranger.\"  Charley was too happy for words. \"I'll do my best,\" he said, with quavering tones. But in a moment he got command of himself. \"You told me I couldn't handle a crew of men,\" he said.  \"Maybe you can't, Charley, but you've handled everything else and handled it well. It is plain that you love the forest and understand as much about its needs as any ranger I have. A little experience is all you need to make a first-class ranger. I'll give the men a talking to. When I get done, they'll know it won't pay to monkey with you, even if you are only a high school boy. Now, Ranger Russell, I think we had better turn in and get some sleep, for we'll have to pull foot early to-morrow.\"     Chapter XXI  A Trouble Maker    Pull foot early they did, too. Charley himself was no sluggard, but the forester's capacity for work simply amazed him. He knew the forester was on the job late every night, for he reported to him each night the last thing before he went to bed. Yet whenever the forester spent the night with Charley, Mr. Marlin was up at an early hour; and the present occasion proved no exception.  Mr. Marlin had never said much about himself to Charley, and no one else had happened to do so; but Mr. Marlin had worked himself up from the ranks. He had been a fire patrol and later a ranger, and then had attended the state forestry school, as the other district foresters had done.  His unusual training, great diligence, intelligence, and untiring energy had made him one of the ablest men in the service. By sheer ability he had won for himself the oversight of this district, which was one of the most important in the entire million acres of state forest lands.  Hardly was the forester afoot this morning before he had a fire going and breakfast cooking. Before breakfast was ready, the two forest guardians began to strike camp. Charley took down his wireless and stowed it as compactly as possible. The tent was lowered and rolled up. Everything was gotten into portable shape, and as soon as breakfast was over, the dishes were washed and they, too, were added to the bundles.  \"I don't care to let anybody know where your camp was,\" said the forester. \"I may want to use this site again. So we'll have to pack our stuff out ourselves, at least part of the way. I am going to put a crew of men in here to-morrow and they can finish carrying out the duffel if we cave in before we reach the road. It will be a pretty good load.\"  Each of them strapped a big pack to his back. The rifle and the fishing-rod had been fastened to the battery, which in turn was roped to poles for handles. In this way it was possible for the two to carry all Charley's outfit. By sun-up the two were already on the trail. They toiled up the slope and crossed the ridge close to Charley's watch-tower. The way was rough and the going hard. But once they struck a fire trail, the path was easy. Yet at best it was a hard and toilsome hike, and several hours elapsed before they reached the forester's motor-car, which he had concealed in the pines. Both of them were tired, and Charley felt as though his arms were about ready to part from his shoulders.  Most of their journey had been made in silence. But now that they were seated comfortably in a motor-car, they once more began to talk.  \"I had to bring you in from the forest, Charley,\" explained Mr. Marlin, \"because as a ranger it will be necessary for you often to be at headquarters. I have arranged for you to live with Ranger Lumley. His district adjoins yours, and his house, right in the forest, is near the dividing line. So it will be about as convenient for you as it is for him. He is to be at the office to meet us and look after you. We'll pick him up and go on to his house with your things.\"  Ranger Lumley was on hand as the forester had said he would be. Charley had found Ranger Morton and his wife so likable that he was glad indeed of the opportunity to become acquainted with this second ranger. But the minute he laid eyes on him, he felt a chill of disappointment. Yet he could not have told exactly why. Somewhere, too, he felt sure, he had seen the man before; though he could not remember when or where.  Lumley was a man small of stature, with a hooked nose, fishy blue eyes, a thin, hard mouth, and a face seamed and wrinkled. Yet he was quite evidently not an old man. Charley had noticed that some of the tough characters in his home town looked like that, and the more he studied Ranger Lumley's face, the less he liked the man. Particularly did he dislike his eye. Once he caught the ranger looking at him slyly, and the gleam in the ranger's eye reminded Charley of the vicious look of a horse when he shows the white of his eye. It seemed to Charley, too, as though there was something suggestive of craftiness and cunning in the man's countenance.  When they reached the Lumley home, Charley felt his dislike for the man increasing. Unlike the neat and attractive dwelling of the Mortons, the Lumley house was dirty and disorderly. The children were unclean and ragged. They had no manners whatever. Yet they obeyed readily enough when their father spoke to them. But it did not take Charley long to discover that they obeyed because of fear. When he realized that, he thought of the vicious look he had noted in the ranger's eye. There were dogs innumerable about the place, and they all slunk away when their master approached. Yet all the time, as he showed Charley about, the ranger was almost obsequious. This evident contradiction between the man's actions and his looks made Charley distrust him immediately, and it was with heavy heart that he said good-bye to Mr. Marlin and watched him drive away.  The ranger showed Charley to the room that was to be his. Charley began to carry his luggage up-stairs. He would much rather have taken it all himself, but the ranger insisted upon helping him. When Charley saw how the man eyed every package and scrutinized every article, he understood quickly enough that Lumley wanted to help him, not because of any wish to be courteous, but simply because of his burning curiosity. Especially was the ranger curious about Charley's wireless outfit, but Charley volunteered no information.  The more Charley considered his situation, the gloomier he felt concerning it. He had looked forward to his coming, after Mr. Marlin had told him of the arrangement, with a feeling of pleasant anticipation. Charley was not the least bit shy and made friends readily. He had a feeling that all the men in the Forest Service must be pretty fine men and that their interest in their work would make them, like Mr. Marlin and Mr. Morton, eager to help a recruit. Thus Charley had believed that Lumley would be very helpful to him. He had intended to put himself more or less in Lumley's hands and trust to the ranger for guidance. But a very few minutes spent with Lumley made Charley feel that he could not take the man into his confidence. He almost felt as though he dared not, though when he came to consider the matter fully, that attitude seemed foolish. Lumley was a guardian of the forest as well as himself, and surely he could trust him with matters that pertained to the forest.  Charley tried to fight down this feeling of distrust. It seemed to him very wrong to accept a man's hospitality, even if he was to pay well for it, and at the same time be suspicious of the man. But hardly had he decided that he ought to be frank with his fellow ranger when Lumley began asking questions that caused the feeling of distrust to return with renewed force. Lumley's questions were intended to seem innocent enough; but Charley was sharper than he perhaps looked, and he saw the real intent behind the questions. The man was slyly trying to find out all he could about Charley's history, and particularly how much Charley had been paid as a fire patrol and what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.

Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger.  Charley answered most of Lumley's questions openly enough, but could not tell him what he was to get as a ranger, for he had never once thought about the matter, nor had Mr. Marlin mentioned it. But when Charley told Lumley so, he could see that the ranger did not believe him.  When the ranger began to question Charley about his recent work in the woods, Charley answered him evasively and soon turned the conversation to other matters.  While Charley was arranging his duffel, two or three dirty youngsters came bouncing into the room and at once began to drag Charley's wireless apparatus from the pasteboard box. With a cry Charley sprang toward them and snatched the instruments out of their hands. The ranger gave a savage oath and aimed a kick at the lads, but they dodged and ran from the room.  At first Charley was terribly annoyed. But in a second he was glad the incident had happened. Nothing had been injured and he had had a warning of what might be expected. It gave him a good opportunity to shut up his things without seeming to be suspicious of his host. Charley acted at once.  \"I have no need of this wireless outfit at present,\" he said, \"and if you have a spare box and some nails, I will just nail these things up until I have time to set up the outfit.\" So the wireless instruments were safely boxed up and locked in a closet, along with Charley's rifle and fishing-rod. There was nothing in his remaining luggage that could be much harmed, even if the youngsters did get hold of things.  As soon as his belongings were stowed away, Charley decided that he would go to the forester's office and talk over his work. He had three miles to walk, and although he had already trudged several times that distance, heavily loaded, he did not hesitate for a moment. When Lumley suggested that he use the telephone and avoid the walk, Charley merely smiled.  \"I don't mind it,\" he said.  \"I'd like to see myself walk that distance for any such fool errand,\" growled the ranger.  When Charley had said he didn't mind the walk he had told the truth. Yet he had understated it. The fact was that he hugely enjoyed the walk. He was rested from his long carry, and with nothing to weight him down, his feet felt light as feathers. He trudged briskly along the smooth highway, every sense alive to the delights of the forest. All about him the woods were vocal with the calls of birds. The wind whispered and sighed in the pine tops. And sometimes, when the air in the bottom was still as sluggish water, Charley could hear the wind roaring among the trees far up on the hillsides. The scent of spring was in the air--that indescribable mixture of the smell of opening buds and flowers and green things and rank steaming earth, that together make such an intoxicating odor. And all about him Charley caught glimpses of the wild life of the forest.  It was late in the day when he reached the forester's office. The forester seemed greatly surprised to see him.  \"I came to talk to you about my work,\" explained Charley.  The forester frowned. \"What is the telephone for?\" he asked a bit brusquely.  \"I didn't want to talk over my business before that man,\" protested Charley.

And there's nothing I can think of I'd rather do than help take care of the forest.\"  \"Very good,\" said the forester, \"but I need patrols now, not after school closes in June.\"  \"Maybe I could get excused for the rest of the term,\" pleaded Charley.  \"And throw away your chance to graduate? I don't think I want that kind of a boy for a fire patrol,\" said the forester with a frown. \"You might decide to quit this job, too, about the time we stacked up against a hot fire.\"  Lew spoke up. \"You don't understand what Charley means, sir,\" he explained. \"Charley is away ahead of most of us in his school work. He's done enough now to give him his diploma.\"  \"Indeed!\" replied the forester.  Then he turned to Charley in apology. \"I beg your pardon, young man. I misjudged you.

But you are too young.\"  Charley turned his head away to hide the tears that he could not keep back as he saw the opportunity slipping away from him. Then he dashed his hand across his eyes and again faced the forester.  \"You do not understand who we are,\" he said with determination, \"nor what our qualifications are. I am accustomed to the woods, sir. I know something of woodcraft. I have fought fire in the forest. I have spent weeks in the mountains. And I am a wireless operator, sir. Are any of your patrols better qualified?\"  The forester looked at him narrowly for several seconds. \"See here,\" he said severely. \"Did you boys set this forest afire?\"  Charley looked aghast. \"Set the forest afire!\" he exclaimed in amazement. \"Certainly not. Why should we?\"  \"Are you telling me the truth?\"  Even through the grime Charley's face was red. \"See here,\" he said angrily, \"I don't care whether you are the forester or the President of the United States. You are not going to call me a liar. If Lew and I hadn't been here fishing, you wouldn't have any forest by this time. We've fought this fire for hours and it's only a piece of luck that Lew isn't dead. He'd have been burned to a crisp if I hadn't found him just when I did. We've done everything we could to save the forest. I demand to know your reason for suggesting that we started the blaze.\"  \"Young man,\" said the forester, \"more than one forest fire has been set by persons who wanted a job fighting fire. You wanted a job. You told me what an advantage your wireless would be.  \"My ranger reported to me by telephone last night that excepting for yourselves he had seen nobody in this region all day. This morning a fire breaks out; you report it promptly by wireless; and when we arrive, you have it almost out. Isn't that a suspicious chain of circumstances? Doesn't it look as though you might be trying to show the forester something?\"  \"A fellow who would set the forest afire just to prove his own qualifications as a fire fighter ought to be put in prison,\" said Charley indignantly. \"Do you think I'm that kind of a skunk?\"  \"No, I don't,\" said the forester. \"I believe you boys had no hand in starting this fire and that you have risked your lives and done heroic work to save the forest. But I had to be sure. There is something queer about this fire. With no railroads near to shoot up sparks, no thunder-storms to flash lightning, and no campers to be careless with their fires, what did cause it? It isn't the first time mysterious fires have started in this fine timber. You saw in the other valley what two of these fires did before we got them out. This is the third fire that has occurred in this tract. If it hadn't been for you boys, I hate to think what would have happened. You have done a great service to the people of Pennsylvania.\"  Charley was suddenly abashed. \"I'm awfully sorry I called you a profiteer,\" he said humbly. \"I beg your pardon.\"  \"It's all right, young man,\" said the lumber dealer, a smile once more lighting up his face. \"You are too young to understand how critical the business situation really is. But be careful in future how you call people names.\"  \"I certainly will,\" agreed Charley. \"But I'd like to know this. Who <i>is</i> profiteering in lumber? Who is responsible for such terrible prices?\"  \"Well, there <i>has</i> been profiteering in lumber, as in everything else. But there is a real reason why the price of lumber is so high, and that is the scarcity of timber.\"  \"Scarcity!\" cried Charley incredulously. \"Why, the forests are full of timber.\"  \"And what is it like?\" demanded the lumber dealer. \"Go out to the forests and look at it. There's nothing but little poles that will scarcely make six-inch boards. We don't produce one-fourth of the lumber we use in this state, and we are using wood ten times as fast as our forests are growing it.\"  \"I thought Pennsylvania was a great lumbering state,\" protested Lew.  \"For a good many years it led the nation in the production of lumber, young man, but now it ranks twentieth among the states. If only fire could be kept out of the forests, we might some day raise our own timber again. But the lumbermen chopped down the big trees and fire has destroyed the little ones and even burned the forest soil so that nothing grows in it again. We have not only destroyed our forests, but we have so injured the land that new trees do not grow to take the place of those we cut.\"  The two boys stared at the lumberman in amazement. \"Where <i>do</i> we get our lumber from?\" demanded Lew.  \"Practically all of it comes from the South. That's one reason lumber costs so much here. The people of Pennsylvania pay $25,000,000 a year in freight charges on the lumber they use. That's one of the reasons those cedar boards you were looking at cost so much. When the new freight rates go into effect the cost of hauling our lumber to us will be something like $40,000,000 a year.\"  The two boys were very thoughtful as they made their way back to Charley's shop.  \"What are people going to do for wood pretty soon?\" Lew inquired of his companion. \"If we can't build a little boat because the wood costs too much, how are people going to get homes and furniture and wagons and motor-cars and a thousand other things? Seems to me pretty much everything we use is made of wood.\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Charley. \"But what bothers me more just now is to know what we are going to do during Easter vacation. It may be the last vacation I shall ever have, and I'd like to have a good time.\"  \"Why not follow the lumber dealer's suggestion and go out to the forests? Easter doesn't come this year until after the trout season opens. We could go out to our old camp in the mountains and spend the vacation there, fishing and hiking.\"  \"That's a mighty good suggestion, Lew. If we have our packs ready, we can start from high school the minute it is dismissed. We can make that early afternoon train and get off at that little flag-station at the foot of Stone Mountain. Then we can hike through the notch and reach the far slope of Old Ironsides before dark. We shall have to camp overnight along the run from the spring there, as it is the only water for miles around. Then the next day we can go on into that little valley where we saw so many trout. That is so hard to reach that not many fishermen ever go there. The little stream from the spring on Old Ironsides runs into that brook. Do you remember what lots of little trout we saw not far below the spring? They will have become big fellows by this time and moved down into the larger stream. There ought to be some fine fishing there this spring.\"  \"They say it's an ill wind that blows nobody good. I'm sorry we can't build the boat, but we shall have just as good a time in the mountains as we should have had on the river. We'll borrow that little pup tent of Johnnie Lee's, and take our blankets, hatchets, fishing-rods, and grub.\"  \"I'd rather leave the tent at home and build a lean-to after we get there. Then we could take a portable wireless outfit and talk to the fellows at home here in the evening. Half a dozen dry cells would give us one-sixth of a kilowatt of current, and that ought to carry a message twenty-five or thirty miles easily. At night we might be able to talk fifty miles. We can carry six cells easily. The remainder of the outfit won't weigh much. We'll have to go as light as we can, for it's a mighty tough hike over Old Ironsides and on into that little valley.\"  \"Shall we take our pistols?\" asked Charley.  \"We'd better have at least one. You never can tell when you're going to need a pistol in the forest. Remember the time that bear treed me on the first hike of the Wireless Patrol? I don't ever want to get into another situation like that without something to shoot with.\"  Charley chuckled. \"It wasn't a pistol that saved you then,\" he smiled, \"but Willie Brown and his spark-gap.\"  \"Then we'll be doubly armed,\" replied Lew. \"Since you have so much faith in wireless, you can carry the outfit. I'll pack the gun. We're almost certain to have some kind of adventure, for every time the Wireless Patrol or any of its members venture into the woods, something exciting happens.\"     Chapter III  Off to the Mountains    Busy, indeed, were the succeeding ten days. The outfit that the two boys were to carry was packed and repacked several times, and each time it was overhauled something was eliminated from the packs; for both boys knew well enough that the trip before them would test their endurance even with the lightest of packs. Finally their outfit was reduced to two fishing-rods, one hatchet, a first-aid kit, a flash-light, the necessary food and dishes, one canteen, and one pistol, with the wireless equipment.  This was made as simple as possible. Six new dry cells were to be taken to provide current. Then there were a spark-gap, a spark-coil, a key, and a detector, with the receiving set, switch, and aerial. To be sure, the entire aerial was not packed, but merely the wires and insulators, as spreaders could be made in the forest. Then there was an additional coil of wire to be used for lead-in and suspension wires. No tuning instrument was necessary, because the wireless outfits of all the members of the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol were exactly alike and so were already in tune with one another. Without a tuning instrument, to be sure, it might not be possible for Charley and Lew to talk with anybody except their fellows of the Wireless Patrol. Henry had nothing out of the ordinary to report. Then Charley asked Henry to get the forester at Oakdale on the telephone.  After a long wait, Charley's receiver began to buzz. \"Henry has the forester on the telephone,\" he said. \"What shall I tell him?\"  \"Ask him to tell Katharine that I shall stay here with you in your camp overnight, as I could not get home until long after dark.\"  With fascinated gaze the ranger watched the sparks fly under Charley's manipulation of the key. Then there was a long silence as the three sat waiting for the reply.  \"Katharine says to tell Jimmie she's awful glad,\" said Charley, relaying the forester's message literally, \"and to thank the new patrol for taking care of him.\"  Then and there Charley knew that he was going to like not only the ranger, but also the ranger's little wife. As for the ranger, he was almost spellbound.  \"I know you talked to the chief,\" he said, \"but what gets me is <i>how</i> you did it. Why, if I knew how and had an outfit like that, I could talk to Katharine any time and anywhere.\"  \"We'll make you an outfit and teach you how to use it,\" cried the two boys together. \"You shall have your first lesson to-night.\"  Twilight drew near. Lew brought out the grub bag, and Charley began cooking some food over the little alcohol stove.  \"I think that you can safely take a chance on a wood-fire at this hour,\" said the ranger. \"I'll build it myself.\"  He placed a few dried leaves within the fireplace and stacked some twigs, broken into short lengths, in a cone-shaped heap above the leaves. At once he had a bright little fire that made almost no smoke but gave lots of heat, though the flames did not reach as high as the stone sides of the fireplace. Quickly a little bed of coals formed, and Charley put his frying-pan directly over them. In no time the air was savory with the odor of sizzling bacon and hot coffee.  Squatted about the little fire, the three guardians of the forest ate their evening meal. From time to time the ranger thrust a stick into the fire, and so kept the flames alive. But it was a dim little blaze at best. Yet it was mighty cheering and comforting as the darkness wrapped the forest, and the gloom beneath the rhododendron thicket became inky and impenetrable.  For a long time after supper was eaten and the dishes cleaned, the three sat before their little fire. Spellbound, the recruits listened to this veteran guardian of the forest as he told them of his work in the woods, of his encounters with beasts, of birds and reptiles, harmful and otherwise, and of the rocks, and flowers, and trees. For the ranger loved the forest even as Charley did.  When the evening was farther advanced, and the air was vibrant with the voices of the wireless, Lew and Charley took turns reading the news, while the ranger's expression of amazement and admiration grew deeper and deeper, and his liking and respect for his young subordinate increased rapidly. Finally the ranger was given his first lesson in radio-telegraphy. While Lew was writing down for him the wireless alphabet, Charley was showing him how to make the letters on the spark-gap. Before they turned in for the night, the ranger had learned to distinguish the difference between the sound of a dot and of a dash as the signals buzzed in the receiver.     Chapter XII  On the Trail of the Timber Thieves    Very early the next morning the ranger was afoot. Before ever the faintest streaks of light penetrated the thicket, he had started the coffee to boiling on the little stove, and breakfast was almost ready before he wakened his young comrades.  \"Why didn't you call us sooner?\" asked Charley indignantly, as he leaped out of his blanket. \"It's our place to do the work here, not yours.\"  The ranger smiled. \"It would have been cruel to waken you earlier. It's easy to see that you aren't accustomed to such stiff work as your hike here yesterday must have been. You slept like logs.\"  \"We intend to do our full share of the work,\" said Charley.  \"I'm sure of it,\" replied the ranger. \"If I had thought you were trying to shirk, I'd have had you out of bed long ago.\"  Many a time afterward Charley thought of that statement and pondered over it. He was learning a good deal about life these days.  Grateful indeed was the warm coffee, for the April morn was chill. Quickly the food was eaten, and the ranger prepared to depart.  \"I don't want to burden you with rules,\" he said in parting. \"Your business is to protect the forest. That comes first. You will have to decide how to do it, according to circumstances.\"  The boys carried their duffel to the forester's car. Mr. Marlin telephoned his assistant to look after things during his absence, and in another minute Mr. Marlin and Lew and Charley were whirling along the highway. They reached the point at which they were to enter the forest, jumped to the ground and unloaded their duffel. Mr. Marlin said good-bye, turned his car, and sped back to his office, leaving the two young fire guards alone in the heart of the wilderness.     Chapter X  An Encounter with a Bear    Rapidly the duffel was made into two packs. These were both heavy and bulky.  \"Gee!\" said Lew, as he surveyed the packs, \"I hope we don't meet any state cops. They would arrest us for peddling without licenses.\"  There was small chance, however, of their meeting any one, unless it might be some lone fisherman. On every hand the forest stretched, seemingly interminable.  \"I guess we'd better get our bearings,\" said Charley.  He drew the map from his pocket and spread it on a flat rock. The two boys pored over it for some minutes.  \"We have to cross these two mountains,\" said Lew, \"and camp just the other side of the summit of the third. That's about the same as climbing over three mountains. There are two valleys that we'll have to get across. I judge we'll be just about as far from the road as our old camp was. That's twelve miles or so.\"  \"Gee!\" laughed Charley. \"That means I've got to hike twelve miles over these mountains every time I want to talk to anybody on the telephone. I'm glad Mr. Marlin doesn't care much for talk. The telephone is all right, but compared to the wireless it's like a candle beside an electric light. Mr. Marlin was right when he said the fellows couldn't be listening in for me all the time, but you just bet I'm going to figure out some way to use my wireless. Why, I've got to, if I'm going to make good. This whole neck of the woods could burn up while I'm hiking twelve miles to call help and twelve more to get back to the blaze. And I reckon I'd feel like putting up a stiff fight after hiking twenty-four miles over these mountains. Mr. Marlin is all right, but he isn't quite up to date. He still thinks the wireless is a sort of plaything.\"  \"What you need, Charley, is a battery powerful enough to carry a message from Central City to New York. Just now each lad was engaged in trying to earn money so that the club could buy a battery or dynamo strong enough for this purpose. So each boy was working at any job he could pick up after school, and saving all he earned. Both Charley and Lew had already earned more than their share of the purchase money.  \"You never can tell what will happen,\" said Lew presently. \"Who ever expected Roy to get the job he has? You may land in another just as good. You stand pretty near the head of your class, and everybody knows you're a corking good wireless operator.\"  \"I can tell well enough what will happen, Lew. The minute I'm out of high school, I'll have to go to work with Dad in Miller's factory. Gee! How I hate the place! Think of working nine hours a day in such a dirty, smoky, noisy old hole, where you can't get a breath of fresh air, or see the sky, or hear the birds. Just to think about it is enough to make a fellow feel blue.\"  \"But maybe you won't have to go into the factory at all,\" argued Lew. \"Maybe you can find some other job you like better.\"  \"No, I shall have to go into the factory,\" repeated Charley sadly. \"Dad says I've got to get to work the minute I've graduated, and earn the most money possible. And there's no other place where I can get as much as they pay at Miller's. Dad says I can get two-fifty a day at the start and maybe three dollars.\"  Charley paused and sighed, then added, \"What's three dollars a day if you have to be penned up like an animal to earn it? I'd rather take half as much if I could work out in the open and do something I like.\"  \"Why don't you tell your father so?\"  \"I have--dozens of times. But he says it isn't a question of what I want to do. It's a question of making the most money possible and helping him. He says he's supported me for more than eighteen years and now I have to help him for a year or two anyway.\"  \"That's a shame!\" cried Lew.  \"No, it isn't, Lew,\" explained Charley. \"It's all right about helping Dad, Lew. I want to do that, but I can't bear to think of going to work in that factory.\"  \"It's too bad, Charley. I had hoped so much that we could go to college together.\"  \"Lew, if I could go to college I'd work my head off to do it. You know that. If only I could go to college and learn about the birds and flowers and rocks and trees and animals, I'd be willing to do anything--even to work in Miller's factory for a time. But Dad will need every cent I can earn until I am twenty-one, and I can't see how I can possibly go to college.\"  \"Never mind, Charley. You never can tell what will happen. Look at Roy. He was worse off than you are, for his father died suddenly and Roy had to care for both himself and his mother. And see what came of it. He isn't much older than we are, yet he's got a fine job. Just keep your eyes open and you may pick up something, too.\"  \"It'll have to come quick, then,\" sighed Charley. \"Here it is almost Easter vacation, and I am to graduate in June. This will probably be the last vacation I shall have in a long time.\"  \"Then let's enjoy this vacation. I've been thinking what we could do, and it occurred to me that it would be lots of fun for the Wireless Patrol to make a trip up the river to that old camp of ours. It won't be too cold to camp out if we take out our tents and our little collapsible stoves. Suckers ought to be running good and we can catch a fine mess of fish, take a hike or two, and have a bully trip up the river and back. Let's go tell the rest of the fellows.\"  Lew jumped up and started for the door. Then he stopped suddenly and a look of disappointment came over his face. \"I'll bet none of 'em can go,\" he said. \"They've all got jobs for the vacation. I'm glad we've got our money earned.\"  \"I just thought of another difficulty,\" sighed Charley. \"Not one of us owns a boat.\"  \"We can borrow one,\" said Lew.  \"I hate to borrow things,\" replied Charley. \"You remember how I borrowed old man Packer's bob-sled and broke it and then had to pay to have it remade. No more borrowing for me.\"  \"Why can't we make a boat? There's plenty of time between now and vacation. If we do the work ourselves, it oughtn't to cost more than two or three dollars and then we'd have a boat of our own.\"  \"Bully!\" cried Charley. \"We can make it as good as anybody. We'll do it.\"  \"All right. I'll go down-town and find the price of oars and rowlocks, and you go over to Hank Cooley's and find out how his father made that boat of his. It's a dandy and just what we need.\"  The two boys rushed off in opposite directions, each full of enthusiasm over the plan to build a new boat and make a trip up the river during their Easter vacation.     Chapter II  What Came of Them    A few hours later Charley Russell again sat before the bench in the little wireless house in his father's yard. Before him lay some patterns for a rowboat, and on a piece of paper Charley was trying to figure out how much lumber it would take to build the boat.  \"We'll need two sixteen-foot boards, each a foot wide for the sides,\" he said, looking across the table at his chum, who sat ready, with pencil and paper, to jot down the figures Charley gave him.  \"Thirty-two feet,\" said Lew, setting down the number on his paper.  Charley bent over his patterns, measuring and estimating in silence. \"It'll take three more like 'em for the bottom,\" he said presently.  \"That's forty-eight more,\" replied Lew, jotting down the number.  \"And these cross braces,\" added Charley, after another period of calculation, \"will take ten feet more.\"  Again Lew set down the number.  \"That provides for everything but the decks,\" said Charley. \"They will take seven or eight feet more. Better call it ten. That's all. What does it make?\"  Lew put down ten and added the column of figures. \"One hundred feet exactly,\" he said.  \"Bully good!\" replied Charley. \"A hundred feet oughtn't to cost much of anything. The rub's going to be to get the oars. You say they want five dollars for the cheapest pair at the hardware store, and the sporting goods store wants six-fifty.\"  \"The robbers!\" cried Lew. \"Think of it. Six-fifty for about fifteen cents' worth of wood. Maybe we can get a pair of second-hand oars somewhere. Six-fifty is as much as we can afford to spend on the whole outfit.\"  \"It will be all right to get second-hand oars,\" said Charley, \"for we can get new ones later, when we have the money. Besides, we want to put most of our money into the boat itself. As long as we are going to build it, we want to make it the very best boat possible. We want the best wood in the market and we want our boat light enough so that the two of us can carry it. I reckon it may cost two or three dollars if we buy such good wood as that. But it will be worth while. We can get along with cheap oars for a time. Let's go down to the lumber-yard and get our boards.\"  The two chums left the shop and hurried down the street toward the lumber-yard.  \"If we can get our lumber to-day,\" said Charley, \"I'm certain we can get our boat made before the spring vacation. We ought to be able to put in three hours apiece every afternoon after high school lets out, and we can get in another hour apiece before school, if we get up early enough. That's four hours apiece, or eight hours a day. We certainly ought to get it finished and painted inside of ten days.\"  \"Sure,\" replied Lew. \"We'll have her done all right. And we'll have just about the finest boat in town.\"  \"And I reckon we'll have just about the finest trip ever,\" went on Charley. \"If we start right after school closes for the Easter vacation we can row up-stream that afternoon as far as Hillman's Grove, and camp there for the night. That will give us almost half a day's extra time. Then we can reach our old camping ground the next day and get the tent up and our wood cut and maybe even catch some fish before dark. We'll have everything ready so we can jump right into the boat and pull out the minute school is over.\"  \"Sure,\" assented Lew. Then, after a moment's pause, he added, \"Ain't it a shame none of the other members of the Wireless Patrol, especially selected for their skill in wireless, he had later gone to New York with their leader, Captain Hardy, to assist the government Secret Service in its search for the secret wireless that was keeping the German Admiralty informed of the movements of American vessels.  His fellows both envied and loved him. Roy warmly returned their affection, and his vessel never came into port that he did not, regularly at nine o'clock in the evening, flash out some message of greeting to his former comrades of the Wireless Patrol. It was always a one-sided conversation, however, because none of the boys in the Wireless Patrol owned a battery powerful enough to carry a message from Central City to New York. Just now each lad was engaged in trying to earn money so that the club could buy a battery or dynamo strong enough for this purpose. So each boy was working at any job he could pick up after school, and saving all he earned. Both Charley and Lew had already earned more than their share of the purchase money.  \"You never can tell what will happen. Look at Roy.

Just keep your eyes open and you may pick up something, too.\"  \"It'll have to come quick, then,\" sighed Charley. \"Here it is almost Easter vacation, and I am to graduate in June. This will probably be the last vacation I shall ever have, and I'd like to have a good time.\"  \"Why not follow the lumber dealer's suggestion and go out to the forests? Easter doesn't come this year until after the trout season opens. We could go out to our old camp in the mountains and spend the vacation there, fishing and hiking.\"  \"That's a mighty good suggestion, Lew. If we have our packs ready, we can start from high school the minute it is dismissed. We can make that early afternoon train and get off at that little flag-station at the foot of Stone Mountain. In a moment more it had gone whistling around the shoulder of the hill, leaving the two boys alone on the edge of the wilderness.  Quickly they adjusted their packs and started back along the railroad-track toward the gap through which they were to pass to Old Ironsides. Rapidly they made their way along the road-bed.  \"We'd better hustle while the going's good,\" commented Lew, glancing at the heavy clouds that obscured the sun, \"for it will get dark early to-night. It'll be slow enough going once we leave the track.\"  \"There's one thing sure,\" replied Charley. \"We won't be bothered with wet ground. I think I never saw the earth so dry at this season of the year. There was almost no snow last winter and we've hardly had a rain this spring. Usually it rains every day at this time of year.\"  Charley's prediction proved true. When the boys at last reached the notch in the mountains and left the railroad-track, they found the way almost as dry as a village street. Years before, the timber had been cut from Stone Mountain, and a logging trail had passed up the very gap through which the boys were now traveling. But brush and brambles had come in soon after the lumbermen left and now a thick stand of saplings also helped to choke the path. The briars tore at the boys' clothing and blankets. The bushy growths caught in their packs and straps and wrapped themselves about their feet and legs. Very quickly it became evident that a hard struggle lay before them.  Back from the trail, in the forest proper, there was little underbrush, but the stand of young trees was dense and the way underfoot was so rough and uneven that it was almost impossible to make any headway there. For Stone Mountain was a stone mountain in very truth. It appeared to be just one enormous heap of rocks and boulders. In a very little while both boys were perspiring profusely from their efforts, and both were conscious that they were tiring fast; for the grade up the notch was steep.  \"Gee!\" said Lew, at last. \"This is tougher than anything I ever saw when I was in the Maine woods with Dad. We've got to take it easy or we'll be tuckered out before we get through this gap. Let's rest a bit.\"  He sat down on a stone and Charley followed his example. As they rested, they looked sharply about them. They could see for some distance through the naked forest. The tree trunks stood straight and tall, and seemed to be crowded as close together as pickets on a fence.  \"This sure is a fine stand of poles,\" remarked Lew, \"but it's just as that lumber dealer said. There isn't a tree in it that would make a board wider than six inches. But there's some good timber farther back in the mountains. Do you remember the fine stand of pines in that little valley we're heading for? When we were there three years ago there hadn't been a tree cut in that valley. There must be millions and millions of feet of lumber there.\"  \"And do you remember,\" replied Charley, \"how dark it was under those pines, and how cold the water in the run was, and what schools of trout we saw? Gee! I wish it had been trout season then! But we ought to get'em now. Oh boy! I can hardly wait to get there.\"  \"Then we had better be jogging on. It'll be dark before we know it.\"  \"All right,\" returned Charley, \"but I'm going to get a drink before I go any farther.\"  \"I want one, too. Guess I'll fill the canteen. Then we won't have to, stop every time we want a drink.\"  The two boys scrambled down the slope to the brook. The lumber trail was near the bottom of the notch and they had only a few yards to go. The little run was rushing tumultuously down the notch, splashing over rocks, scurrying over little sandy stretches, ever singing, ever murmuring, in its downward course. Their packs and blankets made it difficult to stretch out flat and drink from the stream, so Lew rinsed out the canteen, filled it, and handed it to his companion. Charley took a good drink and passed the canteen to his companion.  \"Then we'll have to make it after dark,\" said Lew. \"For the canteen is about empty and we've got to have water. I'm so thirsty I could drink a gallon.\"  They said no more, but pushed ahead as fast as their weary legs would carry them.  \"We're not far from the line now,\" suggested Lew. \"This must be the stand of hardwoods we saw from the lookout tree. I doubt if it is more than half a mile to the line.\"  \"Keep your eyes open for blazed trees,\" said Charley. \"We ought to see some before many minutes.\"  They had gone on, perhaps a quarter of a mile, when Lew said, \"It looks pretty thin ahead. Either there is a natural opening in the forest or else the timber has been cut out.\"  Charley thought of what Mr. Morton had told him about timber thieves operating along the boundary lines. He was glad that he had decided to explore this particular section of his district. A moment later he was still more glad, for the stillness of the morning air was suddenly broken by a splitting, rending sound, which was followed by the crash of a great tree as it came thundering to earth. There could be no mistaking the sound. A tree had been felled. Both boys stopped dead in their tracks and looked questioningly at each other.  \"Timber thieves!\" said Charley in a low voice. His cheeks paled a trifle. Then a look of determination came into his eyes.  \"What shall we do?\" asked Lew in a loud whisper.  \"I don't know,\" replied Charley. \"But what bothers me more just now is to know what we are going to do during Easter vacation. It may be the last vacation I shall have in a long time.\"  \"Then let's enjoy this vacation. I've been thinking what we could do, and it occurred to me that it would be lots of fun for the Wireless Patrol to make a trip up the river to that old camp of ours.

I want to do that, but I can't bear to think of going to work in that factory.\"  \"It's too bad, Charley. I had hoped so much that we could go to college together.\"  \"Lew, if I could go to college I'd work my head off to do it. You know that. If only I could go to college and learn about the birds and flowers and rocks and trees and animals, I'd be willing to do anything--even to work in Miller's factory for a time. But Dad will need every cent I can earn until I am twenty-one, and I can't see how I can possibly go to college.\"  \"Never mind, Charley. You never can tell what will happen,\" said Lew presently. \"Who ever expected Roy to get the job he has? You may land in another just as good. You stand pretty near the head of your class, and everybody knows you're a corking good wireless operator.\"  \"I can tell well enough what will happen, Lew. The minute I'm out of high school, I'll have to go to work with Dad in Miller's factory. Gee! How I hate the place! Think of working nine hours a day in such a dirty, smoky, noisy old hole, where you can't get a breath of fresh air, or see the sky, or hear the birds. Just to think about it is enough to make a fellow feel blue.\"  \"But maybe you won't have to go into the factory at all,\" argued Lew. \"Maybe you can find some other job you like better.\"  \"No, I shall have to go into the factory,\" repeated Charley sadly. \"Dad says I've got to get to work the minute I've graduated, and earn the most money possible. And there's no other place where I can get as much as they pay at Miller's. Dad says I can get two-fifty a day at the start and maybe three dollars.\"  Charley paused and sighed, then added, \"What's three dollars a day if you have to be penned up like an animal to earn it? I'd rather take half as much if I could work out in the open and do something I like.\"  \"Why don't you tell your father so?\"  \"I have--dozens of times. But he says it isn't a question of what I want to do. It's a question of making the most money possible and helping him. He says he's supported me for more than eighteen years and now I have to help him for a year or two anyway.\"  \"That's a shame!\" cried Lew.  \"No, it isn't, Lew,\" explained Charley. \"It's all right about helping Dad.

Just keep your eyes open and you may pick up something, too.\"  \"It'll have to come quick, then,\" sighed Charley. \"Here it is almost Easter vacation, and I am to graduate in June. This will probably be the last vacation I shall ever have, and I'd like to have a good time.\"  \"Why not follow the lumber dealer's suggestion and go out to the forests? Easter doesn't come this year until after the trout season opens. We could go out to our old camp in the mountains and spend the vacation there, fishing and hiking.\"  \"That's a mighty good suggestion, Lew. If we have our packs ready, we can start from high school the minute it is dismissed. We can make that early afternoon train and get off at that little flag-station at the foot of Stone Mountain. Then we can hike through the notch and reach the far slope of Old Ironsides before dark. We shall have to camp overnight along the run from the spring there, as it is the only water for miles around. Then the next day we can go on into that little valley where we saw so many trout. That is so hard to reach that not many fishermen ever go there. The little stream from the spring on Old Ironsides runs into that brook. Do you remember what lots of little trout we saw not far below the spring? They will have become big fellows by this time and moved down into the larger stream. There ought to be some fine fishing there this spring.\"  \"They say it's an ill wind that blows nobody good. I'm sorry we can't build the boat, but we shall have just as good a time in the mountains as we should have had on the river. We'll borrow that little pup tent of Johnnie Lee's, and take our blankets, hatchets, fishing-rods, and grub.\"  \"I'd rather leave the tent at home and build a lean-to after we get there. Then we could take a portable wireless outfit and talk to the fellows at home here in the evening. Half a dozen dry cells would give us one-sixth of a kilowatt of current, and that ought to carry a message twenty-five or thirty miles easily. At night we might be able to talk fifty miles. We can carry six cells easily. The remainder of the outfit won't weigh much. We'll have to go as light as we can, for it's a mighty tough hike over Old Ironsides and on into that little valley.\"  \"Shall we take our pistols?\" asked Charley.  \"We'd better have at least one. You never can tell when you're going to need a pistol in the forest. Remember the time that bear treed me on the first hike of the Wireless Patrol? I don't ever want to get into another situation like that without something to shoot with.\"  Charley chuckled. \"It wasn't a pistol that saved you then,\" he smiled, \"but Willie Brown and his spark-gap.\"  \"Then we'll be doubly armed,\" replied Lew. \"Since you have so much faith in wireless, you can carry the outfit. I'll pack the gun. We're almost certain to have some kind of adventure, for every time the Wireless Patrol or any of its members venture into the woods, something exciting happens.\"     Chapter III  Off to the Mountains    Busy, indeed, were the succeeding ten days. The outfit that the two boys were to carry was packed and repacked several times, and each time it was overhauled something was eliminated from the packs; for both boys knew well enough that the trip before them would test their endurance even with the lightest of packs. Finally their outfit was reduced to two fishing-rods, one hatchet, a first-aid kit, a flash-light, the necessary food and dishes, one canteen, and one pistol, with the wireless equipment.  This was made as simple as possible. Six new dry cells were to be taken to provide current. Then there were a spark-gap, a spark-coil, a key, and a detector, with the receiving set, switch, and aerial. To be sure, the entire aerial was not packed, but merely the wires and insulators, as spreaders could be made in the forest. Then there was an additional coil of wire to be used for lead-in and suspension wires. No tuning instrument was necessary, because the wireless outfits of all the members of the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol were exactly alike and so were already in tune with one another. Without a tuning instrument, to be sure, it might not be possible for Charley and Lew to talk with anybody except their fellows of the Wireless Patrol ever since. The difficulty would be to get the battery. Things cost so much now that I don't see how I could ever save enough to pay for it. You know I'll have to give Dad about all I earn.\"  \"I'm going to talk to the boys about it, Charley,\" said Lew. \"Maybe somebody can think of a way out. Gee! We ought to be able to do something, with Roy a regular steamship operator and Henry almost as good as a substitute government wireless man.\"  By this time they were well into the forest. They were climbing through a notch over the first range of mountains. When they reached the valley beyond, they had to turn to their left and go up the valley two or three miles, until they struck a fire trail. This trail led straight over the second mountain, which was really the knob at the head of the burned valley. It was on this knob that they had found the rude watch-tower after their meeting with the ranger, Mr. Morton. Beyond this knob they had still to traverse a wide valley and climb a third mountain before they reached their camp site. But there was a good fire trail almost the entire distance.  Traveling with such heavy packs on their backs, the two lads made but slow progress. Every little while they had to stop to rest. During one of these pauses they heard a low, whining sound.  \"Listen! What is that?\" asked Charley, who loved animals and was keenly sensitive to their sufferings. \"It sounds like a dog.\"  They stood motionless. Faint but distinct came the unmistakable cry of a dog in distress.  Charley dropped his pack instantly. \"There's a dog in trouble,\" he said, \"and we've got to help him.\"  He began to whistle. Then he called, \"Here, boy! Here, boy!\"  From somewhere ahead of them came a joyous bark, followed by a painful whine.  Charley picked up his pack. \"Come on,\" he said, and hastened toward the sound. But he did not go far. Soon he caught sight of a dog, painfully limping toward him. Charley ran up to the animal, which wagged its tail violently and barked with joy.  \"He's only a half grown pup,\" said Charley, noticing the big paws. \"Isn't he a fine young fellow?\"  The animal leaped up against Charley and licked his hand. \"Come here, boy,\" said Charley, taking the dog in his arms. \"Let's see what's wrong.\"  Charley began to examine the animal's paws. The dog submitted patiently. \"Nothing wrong with that one,\" commented Charley, dropping a fore paw.  But when he began to feel the other front foot the dog whined with pain. \"No wonder,\" said Charley with sympathy. \"Look here, Lew,\" and he pointed to an enormous thorn that had embedded itself in the paw.  \"Hold him tight while I take it out,\" said Charley as he drew forth his knife, opened the small blade, slit the skin slightly, and carefully dug the thorn out. The foot was festered and swollen. Charley squeezed out the pus.  \"Don't let him get that paw in the dirt,\" he said, and ran to his pack. He fished out the first-aid kit and got some absorbent cotton and a disinfectant. He wrapped a tiny bit of cotton around the end of a twig, wet it with water from the canteen and swabbed out the little wound. Then he soaked another bit of cotton with the disinfectant and stuffed it into the foot.  \"We'll let that stay there a while,\" he said.  \"The dog is probably lost. We'll keep him until we find his owner.\"  Relieved of the thorn, the little animal frisked about, limping but slightly. He fawned upon Charley and seemed to be trying to express his gratitude.  The two boys shouldered their packs again and started on. Charley whistled to the pup, but the call was unnecessary. The pup stuck to their heels as close as a sticking-plaster.  \"They say two's a company, but three's a crowd,\" laughed Charley, \"but I guess it doesn't apply to dogs.\"  \"You never can tell,\" replied Lew. \"A pup of that age may get you into all sorts of difficulty.\"  \"I'll take a chance on it,\" smiled Charley, as he bent and patted the dog.  They went on. For a long time they traveled in silence, the little dog trotting and frisking at their heels. From time to time they stopped to rest. Their packs were growing heavy and neither felt like talking. They settled to their tasks and plodded on. When they came to the fire trail, they turned to their right and went straight over the first mountain. The way was smooth enough, but the grade was very steep and it tested their endurance to the utmost. Every few minutes they were compelled to rest. Finally they topped the ridge and went down into the next valley.  The bottom here was very wide, for the mountains had drawn far apart. Apparently the valley soil was rich. It seemed to be deep and black, and the trees grew to massive size. Ordinarily the two boys would have taken keen enjoyment in the sight of such fine timber, but by this time they were too tired to care much about anything except reaching their destination.  At the foot of the last ridge they took a long rest. They were just starting on when Lew heard a peculiar little sound behind some bushes just off the fire trail. Curious to know what might have made the sound, he dropped his pack and went to investigate. Behind the bush he found a cunning, little black animal that did not seem to be at all afraid of him. He picked it up and rejoined his comrade.  \"Charley,\" he said. \"See what I have found. What is it?\"  \"It's a bear cub,\" said Charley. \"You had better leave it alone. If its mother came along, she might make it hot for us.\"  \"I'm going to keep it for a pet,\" said Lew. \"I knew a fellow who had a pet bear cub once and----\"  Lew never finished the sentence. A savage growl sounded close at hand and a great black animal came rushing through the bushes. Lew dropped the cub and took to his heels. The bear followed in hot pursuit. She was a great, clumsy, lumbering beast, and yet she got over the ground with astonishing speed. Lew ran as fast as he could, but the bear gained on him at every stride.  \"Climb a tree, Lew,\" cried Charley, slipping off his pack and starting to his chum's assistance. \"Be quick about it.\"  Lew headed for the first tree he saw that was small enough to climb. It was a little pole, a foot in diameter. The lowest branch was seven or eight feet above the ground. Lew raced toward it, gathered himself for a leap and sprang upward. He caught the limb and swung himself up with all possible speed. He was not a second too soon. As Lew's body shot upward, the bear rose on her hind feet, and the vicious swipe of her paw barely missed Lew's body. Lew drew himself erect and climbed upward a few feet, where he paused to look down at the bear.  Meantime, Charley was following the animal. He hadn't the slightest idea of what he should do. The law protected the bear at that season of the year and he did not know whether he would be justified in shooting her under the circumstances or not. And anyway, his rifle was back with his pack. He had his little axe on his hip, however, and he drew it from its sheath so that he would have it ready in case he had to use it.  The problem was settled for him, however, in a very unexpected manner. The little dog, which had been playing with a stick at some distance from the two boys, noticed Charley running and came tearing after him. Then he saw the bear and went after her at full speed. The instant the bear heard the dog, she turned to face him; then as quickly faced about again and started to climb the very tree in which Lew had taken refuge.  \"Get that dog away from here,\" yelled Lew in consternation, as he began to climb frantically toward the top of the tree.  Despite the seriousness of the situation, Charley burst into a roar of laughter. But a second appeal from his chum stifled his laughter. He grabbed the dog and started to carry it away. But he had not gone two rods before Lew called frantically for him to bring the dog back. Charley turned around and saw the bear climbing after Lew. As long as the dog was under the tree, the bear had paid no attention to Lew. But when Charley started away with the pup, the angry bear continued her pursuit. Charley returned the dog to the base of the tree.  \"Sick 'em,\" he cried. \"Catch 'em.\"  The little pup made a terrific clamor and the bear paid no further attention to Lew, who immediately began to look for a way out of his predicament. Within two or three feet of the base of the tree which he had climbed, a second tree had sprung up. But the two had grown away from each other, much like the sloping sides of the letter V. At first Lew thought he could cross over to the other tree, but a careful inspection showed him that this would be impossible. Down where the bear was he could have swung himself from one tree to the other; but the farther up the tree he was the farther he was from the other tree and the smaller the limbs were. And Lew was now as near the top of the tree as he dared to go. To try to leap from his present position to the other tree was not to be thought of. It would certainly mean a fall of thirty feet or more. And Lew did not dare come down nearer the bear, lest the animal should again try to claw him. There was no apparent way to get the bear out of the tree, and Lew knew that he could not stay up where he was indefinitely.  Charley tried to divert the bear's attention to himself by reaching up the tree with his axe and striking the trunk. The bear growled but made no attempt to reach Charley. Her attention was centred wholly on the dog. With her hair erect, her lips drawn back, her ears laid flat, and her massive claws ready to tear and rend, the beast presented such a fearful front that Charley did not dare take the dog away. One swipe of those paws, or one crunch of the great jaws might cripple Lew for life, or even kill him outright.  \"Keep perfectly quiet, Lew,\" said Charley, \"and maybe the bear will forget about you. She's terribly enraged at this pup.\"  Charley felt in his pocket and found a piece of strong cord. He knotted it around the pup's neck and tied the animal to the tree.  \"I hope that bear won't come down and kill him while I'm gone,\" he muttered to himself. To Lew he said, \"I've got an idea. I'm going to get the rope and see if I can lasso the bear from the other tree.\"  \"Sick 'em, pup,\" he cried, urging the little dog to make another frenzied outburst. And while the dog was making the valley ring with his clamor, Charley raced to his pack and got the coil of rope. Back he ran and hastily climbed the tree beside the one in which Lew and the bear were resting. The bear eyed him angrily, but kept her attention centred on the pup. Charley climbed to a point a little higher than the limb on which the bear rested. Quickly he fashioned a noose and got his rope ready for a throw. Then he realized that he could never make a successful cast among the limbs.  An idea came to him. Drawing his little axe, he quickly cut and trimmed a small limb, leaving a fork on the end of it. He put the noose on the forked end and cautiously extended the pole. All the while he was urging on the dog, which now began to jump up against the trunk of the tree. The bear more and more centred her attention on the yelping dog. Her hair bristled, and she growled continually. She bent her head down and got ready to deal the dog a savage blow if he came up the tree. Her posture could not have been better for Charley's purpose. Swiftly but quietly he extended the pole until the noose was just beyond the bear's nose, then lowered it swiftly and pulled back hard on the rope. Luck was with him. The bear, taken utterly by surprise, was fairly noosed before she saw the rope.  Charley's sharp jerk to tighten the lasso almost pulled the bear from her perch. She grasped the trunk of the tree with her paws to avoid falling, and that gave Charley an opportunity to tighten and secure his rope. To keep from falling, the bear had to maintain her hold on the tree. Thus she could not claw or bite the rope.  \"I've got her,\" shouted Charley.  It was true enough. In a moment he was almost sorry that he had her. For Lew could not reach the ground without climbing past the bear, and although the animal was caught by the neck, he dared not trust himself within reach of those fearful claws. It occurred to Charley that perhaps he could strangle the bear, or even pull her from the tree. He did not want to kill the animal lest he get into difficulty with the law and so incur the displeasure of his chief. Nor did he want to tumble her to the ground because that would certainly mean the breaking of his rope and the probable loss of part of it.  \"What are we going to do, Lew?\" he called.  \"There's a strong limb about four feet above her head,\" replied Lew, peering down through the branches. \"If you could get your rope over that, we could drop her to the ground and strangle her until she's about all in. Then we could cut the rope and beat it.\"  \"That sounds all right,\" said Charley, dubiously, \"and I guess we'll have to try it. I see nothing else to do.\"  Fortunately his rope was long. He had taken a turn or two around a limb before making his cast, and he now held the bear taut, with ease. The loose end dangled down the trunk.  \"I don't know about this,\" said Charley with a wry face. \"It isn't as simple as it looks. I'll have to unwind the rope from this limb and hold it with one hand while I throw the loose end with the other. I don't know whether I can do it or not. And how am I to get the end again?\"  \"Can't you catch it with your pole?\"  Charley looked at the pole. He had let go of it when he noosed the bear, but it had lodged in a branch within reach.  \"Here goes,\" he said. \"I'll try.\"  Cautiously he unwrapped one winding from the limb. Then bracing himself, and pulling hard so as to keep the line taut, he unloosed the second coil. The rope now hung free in his hand. The bear was not quiet for a moment. She had struggled constantly from the instant she was noosed. She continued to tug and pull at the rope. But she was at such a disadvantage that she could not put her full weight into her struggles. Nevertheless the strain on Charley's arm was terrific. To lessen the tension would give the bear more leeway and so make the strain still greater. And to hold the bear with one hand, while he cast his rope and got it in with the other, Charley at once saw was impossible.  \"I can't do it, Lew,\" panted Charley. \"She's nearly pulling my arm off.\"  He gathered up the rope and put it back over the limb, preparatory to taking a turn about the branch once more. While he was attempting to work the rope around the limb, the dog suddenly increased his clamor.  The bear gave a terrific, convulsive jerk on the rope and jerked it through Charley's hand. The sudden pull completely unbalanced him and he fell from the limb. But instantly he tightened his clutch on the slipping rope and in a second was dangling in air, frightened but safe. He slid to the ground, and drew the rope taut. Now he had the rope over a limb, as he wanted it, but the limb was on the wrong tree.  \"I'll try it, anyway,\" he said.  He tied the end of the rope about the trunk of the tree in which Lew and the bear rested.  \"I'm going to pull her off her perch, Lew,\" he cried. \"If I succeed, she'll swing over toward the other tree. I may be able to pull her up on her hind feet. Anyway, I think I can hold her, and if you come down as quick as you can, the two of us can certainly pull her up. Are you ready?\"  Lew came down the tree as far as he dared. \"I'll be with you the second she drops,\" he said. \"Pull!\"  Charley suddenly threw his entire weight on the rope. The bear, taken by surprise, was jerked clear of the limb. She dropped downward and then swung toward the other tree like an enormous pendulum. Lew slid down the tree like a flash and landed in a heap beside Charley. He was up in an instant, and, grabbing the rope, added his weight to Charley's. The bear was fairly on the ground, but almost straight under the limb over which the rope hung. She was clawing frantically at the noose.  \"Let's give a jerk,\" said Charley. \"Together--now!\"  They strained suddenly at the rope and the bear rose to her hind feet to ease the strain on her neck. Instantly they pulled in the slack.  \"We've got her now,\" cried Lew. \"Pull again!\"  Once more they strained at the rope. It tightened about the neck of the bear, shutting off her wind. She rose to her very tiptoes and the boys pulled in a little more slack.  \"We could choke her to death now,\" said Charley, \"but we mustn't. How are we going to get out of this?\"  \"Let's tie the rope fast and take our packs some distance away. She won't strangle for a while. Then we can come back and free her. I think she will not attack us, for she is too much afraid of the dog. We'll keep him on a leash and beat it the minute we get the rope.\"  \"But how are we going to get the rope?\" demanded Charley.  \"Gee! You've got me. Maybe we'll think of something while we're carrying the packs away.\"  The two boys got their packs and hurried along their route for some hundreds of yards. Then they laid their packs down and ran back. But Charley carried his rifle on the return trip.  The bear was still pawing at the rope when they got back. The hair on her neck was worn off by her violent struggles, and the skin was bleeding freely.  \"That bear will wear a collar on her neck for life,\" said Charley. \"If we ever see her again, we'll know her.\"  An idea came to him. \"I've got it,\" he said. \"I'll cut that rope with a bullet. You stand ready with the dog, and I'll be ready for a second shot, if necessary. We're not going to take a chance of being badly hurt, law or no law.\"  Lew untied the dog from the tree and held the leash with his left hand. Charley handed him the axe, and Lew stepped a little aside where he could use it, if necessary. But it was one thing to talk about cutting the rope with a bullet and another thing to do it, for the bear kept the rope in motion continually. Charley leveled his weapon and tried to get a bead on the rope. It seemed to him that the bear would never stand still. But the beast had nearly reached the limit of endurance. Her tongue was protruding from her mouth, her eyes seemed ready to pop from her head. She was gasping pitifully. Her own struggles were slowly strangling her. Suddenly she stopped fighting and hung limp. The rope stretched like a rod. Instantly Charley's rifle cracked. The line was severed as though some one had cut it with a sword. It flew upward into the tree and the bear dropped to the ground. The noose about her neck came loose and she breathed freely.  \"Quick!\" cried Lew. \"She'll be on her feet in a second.\"  Charley untied the rope from the tree, drew the severed end to earth, and gathering up rope and rifle, fled toward his pack, with Lew at his heels, dragging the frantic dog by main force, for the animal was wild to charge the fallen bear.  As they ran, they glanced back over their shoulders. At first the bear did not move. Then she stirred uneasily and a second later, rose to her feet and ran madly away. The boys stopped running.  \"I guess both parties had a lesson,\" said Lew.     Chapter XI  The Secret Camp in the Wilderness    Their encounter with the bear made the two lads forget for a while their weariness. They made fast time along the fire trails. After a long tramp, they topped the final ridge and paused to rest and study the country. This they could do with ease, for the summit of the mountain was rather sparsely timbered. A very little search disclosed a tree that was at once tall and easy to climb, and that was surrounded only by low brush that would not obstruct the vision. From this lookout they gained a wide view in every direction.  \"We can see for miles and miles,\" said Charley. \"The forester was right in telling us to come often to this lookout. We can discover more from here in a minute than we could by a week of wandering about among the trees.\"  Slowly the boys swept their vision around the horizon. Everywhere the mountains appeared to bask in the warm spring sunlight, seemingly as secure as cats dozing by a fireplace. The fleecy clouds, passing across the face of the sun, threw shadows on the hillsides, making beautiful patterns of sun and shade. In the bottoms the night mist had gathered in little pools, in places completely blotting out the landscape. The tree tops, upthrusting through these banks of fog, looked like wooded islets in tiny gray lakes. In every direction the two boys scanned the country, looking sharply for slender spirals of smoke. But they saw only mist curling upward.  \"It looks to me,\" said Lew, \"as though mighty few people ever get into this valley. It's such a hard journey to get here that I suppose the fishermen will stop at the streams in the valleys nearer the highway, and nobody else would want to come here at this time of year. Unless this timber is set afire purposely, I believe there is not much danger of its being burned.\"  \"There's just the rub,\" replied Charley. \"It would naturally be safe, being so hard to get to, and for that reason it wouldn't be watched as well as more accessible regions, particularly when it is difficult to get fire patrols. But because some one is evidently trying to burn this particular stand of timber, it is especially necessary to guard it. Mr. Marlin wants it watched continually, but so secretly that no one will realize that it is being guarded. That might make the incendiary careless--providing he comes again--and so lead to his detection. We must do nothing to betray ourselves. We'll have to be careful not to mark this tree in any way, so that a passer-by would guess it was used as a watch-tower. And we shall have to be sure that we don't wear a path leading from it to our camp.\"  For many minutes the boys sat in the tree, well screened from observation by the spreading limbs, yet themselves able to see perfectly. In every direction they searched again and again for telltale columns of smoke, but saw nothing.  \"It looks to me,\" remarked Charley, \"as though there isn't a soul in this region except ourselves. If that is so, it is the best possible time to do a little exploring. Suppose we take a look at the valley above our camp. We can cover a lot of ground between now and noon and yet get back here for another observation during the dinner hour. We ought to be in this watch-tower or at some other point equally good every time men would naturally be having fires, and that means morning, noon, and night. Between times we can explore the forest. It means some pretty stiff hiking, but I guess we can stand it.\"  They drew their map and compared it with the country as it actually appeared.  \"We aren't so far from the end of the state land in this direction,\" commented Lew. \"That's the very place you suggested exploring. We might look up the line, as Mr. Morton suggested. You notice the stand of pines ends a long distance this side of the line. That's all hardwood forest up that way.\"  \"The sooner we get at it, the better,\" agreed Charley.  Carefully they descended the tree, picked up their fishing-rods, and hastened down the mountainside as fast as it was safe to travel. The nearer they came to the centre of the valley, the larger the trees grew. Evidently the rich soil had worked down into the bottom, during the centuries, and the tree growth was enormous. Under these huge trees there was no underbrush, and the two boys could make fast time. They approached the stream, which flowed swiftly along under the tall pines, where they had no doubt trout innumerable lurked in the shadowy depths. The temptation to stop and fish was strong, but they put it aside and pushed on up the valley.  For a long time they passed like ghosts among the pines. The earth was springy with the accumulated needles of many years, into which their feet sank silently. Under the huge trees everything seemed to be hushed. There was no wind to set the pines awhispering, and the music of the brook stole through the forest like the low singing of a muted violin string.  For a long distance they passed through a pure stand of pines. Then the character of the forest began to change. Soon they were in a mixed growth, and not long afterward they found practically nothing but deciduous trees about them.  \"We're not far from the top now,\" Lew said after a time. \"I see our old landmark over to the left. It isn't more than half a mile from that to the water. We'll make it all right.\"  But he had hardly gone fifty yards before he stopped and cried out. Before him lay a blackened, desolate area that stretched the remainder of the way to the summit. Fire had swept over the spot. But it was not the fact that fire had been through the region that made Lew cry out. Fire and subsequent storms had practically leveled the stand of trees between the spot where Lew stood and the summit. Here and there a blackened tree thrust its bare trunk upward, limbless, its top gone, a ragged, spectral, pitiful remnant of what had been a beautiful tree. But mostly the thick stand of young poles had been laid low even as a scythe levels a field of grain. And these fallen poles lay in almost impassable confusion, twisted and tangled and in places heaped in towering masses. A barbed wire entanglement would hardly have been a worse obstacle. To penetrate the mass, even in the light of noon, would have been no easy work; but to cross the area now, with dusk fast deepening to darkness, was indeed a difficult task.  \"Well,\" said Lew, after a few searching glances at the burned area, \"we've got to go on, and we might as well plow straight through it. I can't see that one way looks any easier than another.\"  They went on, slowly, painfully. Now they were forced to crawl underneath a fallen tree, now to climb over one. Again and again their way was completely blocked by high barriers of interlocked trunks and branches. Sometimes they had to mount the fallen trunks and cautiously walk from one to another. Darkness came on apace. They could hardly see. The flash-light was brought forth, the last drop in the canteen swallowed, and they started forward on their final push.  \"It's only a few hundred yards to the top, now,\" said Lew. \"It will be easier going down the other side.\"  Painfully slow was their progress. More than once each of them tripped and fell. The sharp ends of the broken branches tore their clothes and scratched them badly. But silently, doggedly, they pushed on. At last there remained but one barrier between them and the summit. It was a great pile of fallen trunks that had no visible ending. There was nothing to do but go over it. From one log to another they scrambled up, each helping the other, advancing a foot at a time, and examined the ground minutely. Not a leaf nor a stick, nor yet the bushes or tree trunks escaped observation. At last Charley gave a little cry. He had found a footprint that corresponded exactly with one they had studied by the brook. A little farther on a second imprint was visible, and the leaves again had the appearance of having been disturbed. For some distance they continued to search for and to find footprints and other unmistakable signs of the passage of the two men.  \"It is useless to look for any more tracks,\" said the ranger, straightening up. \"Collins and his companion quite evidently went up this valley instead of the one they told you they were heading for. They were merely trying to mislead you, which makes me all the more certain they are here for no good purpose. They certainly had no reason to suspect your connection with the Forest Service, and I presume that Collins was so annoyed at being seen by anybody that he just couldn't keep his temper. So he swore at you. He's a violent chap. It's certain that he's somewhere ahead of us, with at least two hours' start. We'll try to overtake him, though we don't want him to see us. What we'll do if we find him will depend upon circumstances. Now let's hustle. But be quiet and keep your eyes open.\"  Not until near sundown was the search discontinued. Then, finding themselves almost directly below the watch-tower, the ranger and his two helpers struck directly up the slope, took a long, careful look for smoke, and descended toward Charley's camp.  \"I'm going to spend the night with you,\" explained the ranger. \"I wish that you would try to call up Katharine and tell her how it is. I don't like to leave the forest until I find out what those scamps are up to.\"  They came to the camp. The pup was still in the tent, and everything seemed to be as it was when the two young patrols left in the morning.  \"Things seem to be all right,\" said Charley. \"We'll be a bit cautious and cook on the alcohol stove to-night.\"  But when he went to the spring for water, he gave a cry of dismay. In the soft ground by the spring basin was a footprint exactly like that they had traced so painfully in the other valley.     Chapter XV  The Telltale Thumb-Print    More serious than ever was the ranger's face when Charley showed him the telltale footprint.  \"It's bad!\" he said. \"Altogether bad! He's as cunning as a rat, that Bill Collins. But how he could ever discover a camp so well concealed as this one is, I don't know.\"  And with that the ranger fell into a brown study. Lew and Charley went on rapidly with their preparations for supper.  \"Here,\" called the ranger, noticing what they were about. \"Mr. Marlin sent this to you. I almost forgot about it.\" He reached into the capacious inner pocket of the hunting-coat he wore and drew forth a bulky package.  \"Beefsteak!\" cried Charley, opening the package. \"Oh boy! And enough for two meals. We're certainly obliged to you and Mr. Marlin both.\"  Meantime, the pup, neglected, fawned upon them and began to whine, when suddenly the ranger cried out, \"I've got it. It was the pup.\"  \"The pup?\" echoed Charley. \"What about the pup?\"  \"Why, it was the pup that betrayed the camp. In some way those men got within hearing or smelling distance of this place, and the pup must have barked or whined. You know how a lonely dog will howl and carry on. I'm sorry, but I guess that pup will have to go, Charley.\"  Charley's face expressed almost as much mental agony as the pup's whine had shown, though he said nothing. The ranger, looking up, caught the expression, however, and understood. He knew how lonely it would be for Charley after Lew returned to Central City. \"The harm's already done,\" he continued, \"and I suppose it never does any good to lock the stable after the horse is gone. You may keep your pup, Charley; but I do wish he was a dumb brute in fact as well as in name.\"  \"I can train him to be quiet,\" said Charley eagerly. \"I trained Judge Gordon's dogs to hunt and I can train this little fellow not to make a noise. If I could keep him, sir, I'd be mighty glad. He'll be a lot of company.\"  \"Keep your dog, noise or no noise,\" said the kindly ranger with determination. \"If you can really train him well, he'll do us a thousand times more good than he does harm. Now that I know Bill Collins is in these woods, I don't like the idea of leaving you here alone. You train that dog as fast as you can. Train him to warn you of the approach of strangers, and train him to fight, too--and to fight hard.\"  Again the ranger lapsed into silence. After a while he said, \"What puzzles me now is this: Should we move your camp to another place or leave it where it is? Bill Collins knows there is a camp here. He saw you two boys in the forest and he has probably seen no one else. He will likely infer that it is your camp. But he has no way of knowing that you are connected with the Forest Service, unless, unless--By George! Why didn't I think of that sooner? Ten to one he hid close by and watched for you to come back. If he did, he saw us when we came down from the top of the hill. And if he saw me with you boys, he knows as well as I do why this camp is hidden and what you boys really are doing. I'll bet it made him swear some when he saw me.\" And the ranger chuckled.  \"But maybe he didn't see us,\" suggested Charley.  \"I'd just as soon believe that the sun didn't set. That fellow's a fox for cleverness and a bulldog for persistence. Yet I don't see that we need feel bad, even if he does know where your camp is. We've learned more than he has. We know he's back in these parts and that he is making a secret visit to this timber; for you may be very sure he intended it to be a secret visit.\"  \"But he can't be certain we know who he is,\" argued Charley. \"He is as much a stranger to Lew and me as we are to him.\"  \"True enough, Charley, true enough. It was really a great piece of luck that you boys happened to bump into him. It would have been better, of course, if you could have seen him without being noticed yourself, but in that case we should never have guessed who he was. No; it's a game of checkers between us now, and we've each lost a man to the other. But in my opinion we got a king in exchange for an ordinary checker. What I'd like to know is, who the man is that's with him.\"  \"Supper is ready,\" announced Lew.  The three entered the tent, where Lew had hung the lighted candle lantern, and in the growing darkness ate their meal.  \"It seems to me,\" suggested Lew, \"that it would be best to leave the camp right where it is. If we move it, that will indicate that we know its location has been discovered. If we let it remain where it is, these men won't know whether we are aware if their visit here or not.\"  \"You've a good head on you, young man,\" said the ranger approvingly. \"That's exactly the thing to do. Besides, if we moved it and Bill Collins wanted to find it, he'd stick right to the job until he succeeded. But I don't believe he has any interest in watching this camp or in staying in this forest. It isn't a healthful place for him and he knows it. You see, Bill and I are old acquaintances. It's my opinion that he came in here for some particular purpose and that he'll get right out the instant that purpose is accomplished. Those men didn't have any packs, did they?\"  \"Not a sign of a pack,\" replied Charley. \"Their coat pockets bulged out as though they had sandwiches or something in them, but they hadn't a thing in their hands or on their backs except fishing-rods and creels.\"  \"That settles it,\" said the ranger. \"They can't stay here more than forty-eight hours at the most. And there's no danger of their telling anybody else about your camp because they won't want anybody to know they were here. We'll just consider the camp situation settled.\"  They finished their supper and had begun clear up the dishes when suddenly Charley thought of the fire-clay. \"Oh! I have something to show you,\" he cried, and went to the corner of the tent to get the clay ball. It was just where Charley had left it, but the instant he picked it up he was somehow conscious that it was different. He held the ball up and looked at it critically. Then he hefted it in his hand.  \"Lew,\" he exclaimed, \"how big was that ball of clay we took for a sample?\"  \"Four or five inches in diameter,\" rejoined Lew. \"Why?\"  \"Look at that. It isn't a bit more than three inches thick. I was sure we had more clay than that. I meant to make a little pot of it.\"  \"We did have more. I'm sure of it. You don't suppose those men could have taken any of it, do you?\"  \"Let me see,\" said the ranger.  He took the ball and examined it critically. \"That looks like fire-clay. If it is, and the deposit is of any size, you have found something of value. You know the state sells things like that on a royalty basis. We might be able to develop a good clay business. We like to work up all the business we can, because the revenues go toward the purchase of the equipment we need. You know the legislature won't give us all we need to buy implements for fighting fires, and for fire-towers, and other equipment.\"  \"If we could make a fire,\" said Charley, \"you could soon tell whether it is good fire-clay or not.\"  \"Make a fire,\" said the ranger. \"Collins already knows where our camp is and nobody else will be prowling around here at this hour.\"  In a minute the boys had a fire going. When they had a deep bed of coals, they dropped the ball of clay in it and made more fire on top of the bed.  While they were waiting for the clay to bake, Charley sat down at his wireless key. As it was still early in the evening he did not feel certain that any of the Camp Brady boys would be listening in. He called several times with no response, so he threw over his switch and resumed his conversation with his fellows. When he flashed out his signals a quarter of an hour later, however, he got a prompt reply.  \"I've got 'em,\" said Charley quietly to his comrades. \"And it's Henry talking.\" He was silent a while, listening to Henry's message. Then he said, \"Henry wants to know when Lew is coming home. Vacation is about ended.\"  \"Tell him that I think I'll go back with the ranger to-morrow. I've stayed as long as I possibly can.\"  Again there was a pause. \"He's got her,\" said Charley.  \"Please tell Katharine,\" said the ranger, \"that it was necessary to stay in camp with you to-night. Ask how she and the little girl are.\"  While his friends sat in silence before the crackling fire, Charley took the message. \"Katharine says that everything is all right and ask him to get Katharine on the telephone.\"  Again there was a pause. \"He's got her,\" said Charley.  \"Please tell Katharine,\" said the ranger, \"that it was necessary to stay in camp with you to-night. Ask how she and the little girl are.\"  While his friends sat in silence before the crackling fire, Charley took the message. \"Katharine says that everything is all right and ask him to get Katharine on the telephone.\"  Again there was a pause. \"Henry wants to know what we are doing and whether or not we've had any adventures. I wish I could tell him the real situation. But that would never do.\"  Charley turned to his key and began to tick off a message: \"Everything as quiet as--\" He stopped abruptly. A cry that fairly made him shiver sounded in the forest. He turned to the ranger. \"What in the world was that?\"  \"A wildcat,\" replied the ranger. \"He smells the meat you hung up. You'll just have to be a bit watchful. He may hang around here for days, and sometimes those fellows get nasty.\"  Another piercing cry startled the night. Again Charley shivered. Lew got up and by putting more wood on the fire lighted up the interior of the thicket brightly.  Charley turned to his wireless as a drowning man clutches at a straw. He saw that when Lew had gone and he had nothing but his own powers to depend upon, the wireless was going to be like a life-line to him. He realized that to have the powerful battery he wanted was imperative, if he was to have even a chance to make good in his efforts to protect the forest. And as he and Lew patrolled the timber, he made it evident to his chum what a vital part that battery would play in his success. But neither of them saw any way for Charley to come into immediate possession of it.  As the days passed and the forest still slumbered in safety, the sharp edge of Charley's anxiety wore off. That, too, was normal, for he could not naturally remain at such a pitch of emotion. So his interest in the life about him gradually returned. And indeed there were innumerable objects to interest a nature lover like Charley.  The country itself was enough to make a nature lover happy. When Charley climbed his watch tree and looked about, he could see nothing but forest. East, west, north, south, league upon league, far as the eye could see and much farther, stretched the forest, like a huge green sea. The mountains rose like great waves; and from his lofty perch Charley could see several parallel ridges rearing their crests aloft on either side of him. Distinctly he could see the two bottoms at the foot of the mountain on which stood his watch tree. Splendid stands of timber filled these valleys with swelling streams of water that flashed in the sunlight here and there through little openings in the trees. But what lay in the farther valleys he could only guess, though he knew that each must have its stream and some timber. What else there might be Charley did not know.  It was part of his work as a patrol to find out. And eagerly he looked forward to the daily hikes that would take him here or there or elsewhere in the great forest. Already he loved it; and he wanted to share all its secrets. Had Charley but known it, that very attitude of mind made him more valuable both to his ranger and to the forester. It meant that his work would not be done in a perfunctory manner, but with that genuine interest born of love that alone leads to perfect service.  The two chums made themselves familiar with their own valley from the border line of the state lands above the beaver dam, to a point many miles below their own camp. They found that they were in the heart of the stand of virgin timber, and that the location of their camp was by far the best that could have been chosen for the purpose of guarding the stand.  Charley thought it wonderful that the forester could offhand select such a strategic point. He felt more certain than ever that Mr. Marlin must have an intimate knowledge of the territory over which he had jurisdiction. Could Charley have known how intimate that knowledge was, he would have been amazed. And what he did not even guess was the fact that the forester had planned just such a secret watch on the big timber as Charley was now keeping, and that he had selected the camp site only after days of investigation.  Nor did Charley so much as dream that for some time Mr. Marlin had been looking about for some one he could trust to do the work. The native mountaineers did not command Mr. Marlin's entire confidence, nor did many of them possess the intelligence or education he desired in the man he selected.  Yet his sudden choice of Charley was characteristic of the forester. He always acted quickly when he thought the time for action had come. Charley's grit and pluck in voluntarily fighting the fire, coupled with his membership in the Wireless Patrol, were the factors that led Mr. Marlin to engage him at once. Had Charley known these facts, he might have felt a bit conceited or at least elated over the situation. But his belief was, as Mr. Marlin wished it to be, that the forester had taken him only as a last resort. And Charley was working hard to make good. He could hardly have taken a better way than the road he had chosen--to make himself familiar with all the territory he was to guard, and so to prepare himself for the emergencies that lay ahead of him.  Every day, and every hour of each day, the two boys found much that excited their wonder, for now they were studying nature at first-hand. Taking their dog, they one day climbed the mountain beyond the one on which their watch-tower stood, and came down into a lovely valley. But what instantly arrested their attention was the face of the mountain on the far side of this valley.  Instead of being a timbered slope, this mountain was a sheer precipice of rock that rose abruptly a thousand feet in air. Its rugged sides were seamed and scarred. Here and there a projecting ledge offered a scant foothold, but mostly the face of the cliff was one vast, frowning rock that rose almost perpendicularly. On tiny ledges and in crevices of the rock little ferns grew in masses, hanging down the face of the cliff like green fringes. Wild flowers had taken possession of the crannies. In precarious footholds, where it seemed impossible for them to exist, a few trees had sprung up, their roots crawling fantastically over the rocks in search of bits of earth to grow in, while the tops of the trees stood up slantingly against the face of the cliff. Mostly they were evergreens, and their scraggly branches made irregular dark masses on the face of the precipice.  As the two boys made their way toward the foot of this cliff, a great bird came soaring over the top of it, and sailed in lofty circles over the valley.  \"Look at that hawk!\" cried Lew. \"Isn't he a whopper? Look at the spread of his wings. And see how he soars, without ever moving a muscle. I wonder if he can see us.\"  Evidently the bird saw something, for suddenly it tilted downward, shot toward the earth like a flash, and was lost to sight behind the trees.  \"Whew!\" cried Charley. \"Did you see that drop? It almost took my breath away to watch him.\"  A moment later the bird rose into sight again, bearing in its talons a dark-colored animal of some sort. Though the animal was not large, it must have weighed many pounds. Yet the bird flew upward swiftly, lifting himself rapidly with strong strokes of its wings.  \"Gee whiz!\" exclaimed Charley, after watching the bird a moment. \"That's no hawk! That's an eagle. It's a bald eagle, too. See his white tail and head and the bare shanks?\"  \"Are you sure?\" demanded Lew. \"I've always wanted to see a bald eagle. It's our national emblem, you know.\"  \"I'm pretty sure that's one,\" replied Charley. \"I've read about them and seen pictures of their huts and their work, and that looks exactly like the pictures. And those noises like rifle-shots were their alarm signals. They slap the water with their tails when they are frightened and dive under water. I suppose they're all in their lodges now, and we'll never get a peep at them. Gee whiz! Just think of finding beavers, Lew, real beavers. I didn't know there were any in Pennsylvania.\"  \"It seems to me that I read something about the game commission stocking the state with them a few years ago. I think they put a number of them in the state forests. Doubtless they have multiplied in numbers and started new colonies.\"  \"That explains it,\" said Charley. \"Gee! I'm glad we found these fellows. And I'm just as glad that they aren't timber thieves. You know, Lew, it made me feel kind of queer to think of facing real timber thieves. I didn't like the idea a bit. But I kept thinking about Mr. Morton and what he said about his being blamed if I fell down, and I made up my mind I'd do it, no matter what happened.\"  They now turned their attention to the felled tree once more, studying the innumerable teeth marks, like so many tiny chisel cuts, on stump and butt. Then they noticed the great chips lying about the stump, some of them half as big as dinner plates.  \"It gets me to understand how they can bite out such huge chunks,\" said Lew, \"when their teeth are evidently so small. Why, you'd think an animal would have to have a mouth as big as a hippopotamus to take bites like these.\"  Charley laughed. \"Looks that way, doesn't it?\" he said. \"But as I remember it, what I read said that the beaver gnaws out parallel rings around the trunk and wrenches out the wood between. It's like sawing two cuts in a board and chiseling out the board between them.\"  \"I see,\" said Lew. \"But I should think they'd break their teeth all to pieces.\"  \"So should I. But they have very strong teeth that grow out as fast as they wear away, and that are as sharp as a chisel. I wouldn't want a beaver to bite me. I'll bet he could bite right through a bone.\"  \"I suppose,\" said Lew, \"they cut these trees to use in making their dam; but what gets me is how they are going to get the trees over to the dam. It would take a team of horses to drag this trunk. It's fifteen inches in diameter.\"  \"The article I read,\" said Charley, \"stated that as the beaver dams became higher, the land adjacent was flooded and that the beavers made little canals through the flooded area and floated their logs where they wanted them. You notice that they have gnawed the limbs off of a number of these trees and cut several of the trunks into lengths. I was sure they were sawlogs when I first saw them.\"  \"Well, there isn't enough water here to float a log,\" said Lew, \"though it's mighty wet and it looks as though the water was several inches deep a little farther on. Let's see if we can find a canal.\"  They stripped off their shoes and stockings, and, rolling up their trousers, began to wade. Very soon they found the water nearly knee-deep.  \"There's more water here than there seems to be,\" admitted Lew. \"There's so much marsh-grass and so many water-plants it fooled me.\"  Cautiously they waded about. Suddenly Lew plunged forward, and only by grasping a bush did he save himself from getting completely wet. As it was, he found himself standing upright in three feet of water. After he recovered from his surprise, he felt about with his feet.  \"This is their canal all right enough,\" he said. \"It's very narrow, but it will float anything that grows in this forest.\"  He scrambled out and the two boys made their way back to dry ground. \"How are you going to get dry?\" asked Charley. \"I don't want to make a fire unless it is absolutely necessary.\"  \"Never mind about me. I'll dry off soon enough. Let's find their dam.\"  They made their way toward the run and soon discovered the dam. It was a great pile of branches, stones, moss, grass, mud, bark, etc., that had been built across the stream and extended for rods on either side. It looked very solid, yet the water did not pour over it, but filtered through it.  \"Think of all the work it took to make that,\" cried Lew. \"Why, every stick in it had to be gnawed down and floated here, and all the bark and grass and roots had to be pulled and brought here and the stones collected. And say! How in the world do you suppose they ever handled those stones? And how do you suppose they ever anchored the stuff when they began building? I should think the current would have swept everything away at first. That's a pretty swift stream.\"  \"I read that they start their dams with saplings, which they anchor across the current with stones. They are much like squirrels, you know, and can use their fore paws about as well as we can use our hands. I suppose the stones lose weight by displacing water, but if I hadn't seen these rocks, I'd never have believed that such big stones could be handled by animals no larger than beavers.\"  \"See here,\" said Lew. \"These willow branches must have taken root, for they seem to be growing right up out of the top of the dam. And there's a birch that's surely growing. You know the branches of some trees will root if you put them in water, especially willows. Why, if they continue to grow and take more root, there'll be a hedge of living trees right across this brook. The dam will become so dense that it will back up a great quantity of water. I reckon this bottom will just naturally turn into a swamp after a time.\"  \"Now that's interesting,\" suggested Charley. \"You know the Bible tells us the world was made in six days; but it seems to me it isn't finished yet. Every rain washes down soil from the hills and helps to fill up the valleys and the river-bottoms, and the floods scour out the watercourses and carry earth and stones down to the ocean. And here we see a piece of land that used to be fine, dry bottom, now becoming a swamp. It looks to me as though the earth is changing every day.\"  They examined the dam more critically. \"It's two hundred feet wide if it's an inch,\" said Lew, \"though the brook isn't more than fifteen or twenty. You see, it extends on each side of the brook to land that is a little higher than the level of the stream bank. That's what makes this big head of water. At the least there are several acres of it.\"  \"There's one thing that we haven't seen yet,\" added Charley, \"and that's their houses. They ought to be some distance above the dam.\"  \"I wonder if those are beaver lodges,\" said Lew, pointing to some bulky heaps of brush at a little distance up-stream.  \"That's exactly what they are. They don't look much like houses, do they? But I guess they're pretty snug inside. The entrances are deep under water, you know, so that the ice can't clog them in winter, and so that the beavers can get to their food all right.\"  \"What do they eat, Charley? Do you know?\"  \"Sure. They eat roots, and tender plants, but mostly bark from certain trees. I believe these are willow, poplar, birch, and some others. They cut down the wood in summer and pile it under water in front of their huts and hold it down with stones.\"  \"Well, what do you think of that!\" cried Lew.  \"They eat a pile of it, too. I don't remember how many trees that article said a colony of beavers would eat in a winter, but I'm sure it was up in the hundreds. I remember how astonished I was when I read about it.\"  \"No wonder they clear the forest so fast. I wonder if we ought to tell Mr. Marlin. Maybe he doesn't know about these beavers. They might begin to cut down his virgin pines. I'm sure he wouldn't want that to happen.\"  Charley laughed. \"I'd bet my last dollar that Mr. Marlin knows all about these beavers. You can bank on it that he knows all there is to know about the territory he has charge of. And as for the beavers eating the pines, it seems to me that I read that they never touch evergreens.\"  A ray of sun slipped through the leaves above them and fell directly upon Charley's face. He glanced up and was surprised to note how high the sun had climbed. Then he looked at his watch.  \"Gee whiz!\" he cried. \"We must have been fooling around this beaver dam for more than an hour. We must be about our business. We'll go on and locate the boundary line.\"  \"I wish we could get a glimpse of a beaver,\" sighed Lew.  \"Not much use to wish it,\" said Charley. \"They're furtive, and I suppose they will stay in their lodges for hours. It seems to me I read that they work at their dams mostly at night. We'll go on now, but maybe we could come up here some moonlight evening and see them at work.\"  They made their way around the beaver dam and continued on up the valley. Within a few hundred yards they came upon a blazed tree. Speedily they discovered a second. Then, following the line indicated by these two trees, they rapidly passed tree after tree blazed and painted white, tracing the line entirely across the valley. They picked out some landmarks by which they could readily locate the line again.  \"If anybody except those beavers starts any timber cutting,\" said Charley, \"we'll know in a second whether he's cutting the state's wood or not. Now I guess we'd better hustle back to camp.\"  Lew got their noonday meal while Charley ascended once more to the watch tree at the top of the mountain and made a careful survey of the country. Not a sign of smoke could he see in any direction. No fire was discovered during the afternoon hike. The evening inspection from their tower was equally reassuring. After a brief chat by wireless with their friends at Central City, and through them sent a reassuring good-night to the forester. Then, too tired to listen to the night's news, they wrapped themselves in their blankets and were soon sound asleep.     Chapter XIV  The Trail in the Forest    The following day the two young patrols were to report to their ranger at the appointed place in the forest. Although the ranger had much farther to travel than they did, the boys knew from experience that he was afoot early during the fire season, and they felt certain he would be at the meeting-place before the appointed hour. Charley wanted to be as prompt as his ranger, and so the two boys were astir by the time the first streaks of light tinged the eastern skies.  It was still dark enough to risk a little blaze in their fireplace and the warmth was grateful, for the early morning air was chill enough. Breakfast was soon cooked and their camp put to rights. Then, taking their fishing-rods again, they set forth to patrol the forest. The pup was tied in the tent, lest he should get into trouble with a porcupine or some other creature of the forest, and so make them tardy for their appointment.  Their plan was to travel down their own valley for a distance, then pass through a gap to a fire trail in the next bottom, which would lead to other trails that would take them close to their destination. They had studied out their route carefully on the map, and they made their way with both speed and certainty.  For a long time nothing of moment happened to them. The sun came up bright and clear. No veil of mist floated before the face of the sky. But woolly, white cloud banks sailed lazily aloft, intensifying by contrast the blue of the sky. A gentle wind blew fitfully. The earth steamed fragrantly, sending up an odor joyful to the nostrils. And the little brooks babbled wildly in their joy at the spring-time.  But Charley was not in a responsive mood. The thought of the man Collins and his evil-favored companion weighed upon him heavily. Nor was the knowledge that a wildcat was prowling about his camp reassuring; though Charley was far from being afraid of the beast. And always the dread of fire was in the background of his consciousness. What troubled him more than anything else just now was the approaching loss of his chum. Could Charley have diagnosed correctly the feelings that oppressed him now, he would have known that it was the fear of loneliness more than any fear of Bill Collins or wildcats or forest fires, that made him sad. To read about Robinson Crusoe was all right, but to be Robinson Crusoe was quite a different matter--at least a Crusoe without a good man Friday. And Charley was too downcast at present to realize that the pup at his heels could be to him all that Friday was to his master, and perhaps more.  Again and again Charley turned over in his mind the problem of how he could get the battery he needed. More than ever he felt that he absolutely must have it. Such a battery would cost many, many dollars. To be sure, Charley's salary would soon bring him in enough money to pay for such a battery; but all of his income, or practically all of it, Charley knew, he must give to his father. How he should get around the difficulty, Charley could not see.  As they trudged on, he talked the matter over with Lew again. Lew seemed unduly light-hearted over the matter, and even smiled about it. Instead of sympathizing with his chum, he counseled him not to worry about it, as the way would likely open. That seemed so heartless that Charley was hurt. He thought that his chum, about to leave the forest himself, no longer was concerned. So he fell silent, and walked along in greater dejection than ever.  Long before the sun had touched the zenith, the three forest guards had reached the last ridge that lay between them and the highway.  \"You've come far enough, Charley,\" said the ranger, \"and perhaps it would have been better if you had stopped short of this. If anything should happen in that big timber, you are a long distance from it. There's a good spring part way up this ridge, and it's high enough so that we can get a good view. We'll stop there and eat our dinner. We can watch as we eat. After you've had a good rest, you had better hike for camp. You're a good ten miles away from your tent.\"  They climbed to the spring, took each a good drink, and sat down to eat their food. The panorama that spread before them was wondrously beautiful, but Charley had no heart for scenery. He ate in silence, his eyes for the most part bent on the ground.  After the meal was finished, the three friends sat silent, looking out over the vast range of territory before them, each busy with his own thoughts. If one could have judged by the expressions on their faces, Lew was little short of jubilant. Again and again he smiled and looked meaningly at his chum. But Charley still sat with downcast eyes, heedless of his chum's glances. But why Lew smiled it would have been hard to guess. If he had any scheme in mind, he dropped no hint concerning it.  Finally the ranger rose. \"We've got to shake a leg,\" he said. \"And you had better start back to camp.\"  Charley got up mechanically. His face showed all too clearly what was in his heart. The ranger looked at him searchingly, and a kindly expression came into his eyes.  \"Never mind, Charley,\" he said. \"You won't be alone long. Lew, here, or some of your other friends will be slipping out to spend the week-end with you, and I shall see you regularly twice a week. It may be, in view of Bill Collins' visit, that Mr. Marlin will think I ought to come oftener.\"  \"Have you learned your alphabet yet?\" replied Charley, a sudden gleam of interest crossing his face. \"Just as soon as you learn to use the wireless, we can talk at almost any time. I'm sure that one of the fellows will lend you his outfit.\"  \"I'll make Mr. Morton an outfit myself,\" said Lew. \"I'll make it exactly like yours. Then you two can talk without tuning.\"  \"That will be bully,\" said Charley, beginning to brighten up. Then he turned to the ranger. \"Willie has the forester on the telephone,\" he said. \"What shall I tell him?\"  \"Ask him to tell Katharine that I shall stay here with you in your camp overnight, as I could not get home until long after dark.\"  With fascinated gaze the ranger watched the sparks fly under Charley's manipulation of the key. Then there was a long silence as the three sat waiting for the reply.  \"Katharine says to tell Jimmie she's awful glad,\" said Charley, relaying the forester's message literally, \"and to thank the new patrol for taking care of him.\"  Then and there Charley knew that he was going to like his ranger. Big, broad-shouldered, quite evidently powerful, with a kindly expression, a winning smile, and a deep voice that instantly created confidence, the ranger was a picture of honest manhood. No one could look into his deep blue eyes, set far apart, or examine the lines on his face, at once betokening strength of character with gentleness, and not feel that here was a man in very truth. One knew instinctively that he would never hesitate a second to risk his life to save another's, and that he would be as gentle as a woman in his dealings with all creatures. But the great, strong jaw and the straight mouth and long nose all foretold fearless courage, and were ample warning that the man would be terrible if stirred to wrath.  \"Come in and see our camp,\" said Charley, after the two boys had surveyed the scene in silence. \"The forest is one of nature's very finest gifts. And to think what we do to it by our carelessness. At any minute this green paradise may become a very hell of roaring flame, just because some smoker is too careless to blow out his match before dropping it, or some camper too lazy to make sure his fire is extinguished. Why, it seems to me that a murderer is an innocent angel compared to such a man. Think what he does! He kills the fish and the birds and the animals and perhaps some human beings, and he destroys not only the wood that civilization must have, but he ruins the very ground so that it cannot produce another forest. It seems to me that a man who does that ought to be punished more severely than any mere murderer. Why, a murderer kills only a single being. The man who starts a forest fire kills countless living things. I tell you, Lew, it makes me mighty proud to have a part in protecting this grand forest.\"  The boys were silent, wrapped in thought, until Lew suddenly pointed to a dense growth of evergreens directly below them, and not very far down the ridge. \"That must be our camp site,\" he said. And both boys examined the spot with interest.  \"That must be it,\" said Charley. \"It's dense enough, goodness knows! And there is a little stream of water stealing out of the lower side of the thicket. So there is a spring in there. Let's go down and take a look at it.\"  They shouldered their packs, whistled the pup to their heels, and went down to the thicket. In a space not less than a hundred yards in diameter rhododendrons grew in indescribable density, while above them towered some huge hemlocks. The two boys came close to the thicket and peered into it. Even now, in the bright glare of the full sun, deep twilight reigned beneath the rhododendrons. Evidently they were growths of great age. Their stems were like young saplings. Their tops rose high and spread wide. And their branches were laced and interlaced and twisted and grown together so as to make a mass almost impenetrable.  \"Great Ned!\" cried Lew. \"A passer-by would have about as much chance of seeing us in there as we have of discovering China from this hillside. The question is, how are we going to get into the place?\"  Charley dropped on his hands and knees and crawled slowly under the low rhododendron branches.  \"Keep right in my tracks, Lew, if you come in,\" warned Charley. \"If there are any snakes in here, they'd bite a fellow before he could see them. I'll look sharp for them and if you follow me, you won't run any risk.\"  He picked up a fallen branch, trimmed it, and crept on, stick in hand. Suddenly he crowded back hard on Lew, almost kicking him in the face. At the same time he began to thrash about in the leaves ahead of him.  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" he exclaimed. \"I almost crawled on a big rattler. He was so near the color of the ground that I didn't see him until he coiled and raised his head. Gee! That was a close shave.\"  \"As long as you didn't get bitten,\" said Lew, \"It's a good thing it happened. We'll be on our guard now.\"  \"Yes, indeed. Did you put the potassium permanganate in the first-aid kit, and the hypodermic syringe?\"  \"Surest thing you know.\"  \"We'll just carry them with us, Lew. We won't take any chances on death by snake-bite. These mountains are full of rattlers and copperheads.\"  \"And we won't take any chances on being bitten in this thicket, either,\" answered Lew. \"We'll put the pup in ahead of us.\"  They whistled in the dog and sent him scouring through the thicket. But either there had been no more snakes within it or else all had fled, for the dog raced eagerly about but found nothing to alarm him.  Confidently the boys now pushed into the interior of the thicket. At the very heart of it lay the spring. It came bubbling up through pure, white sand, and had formed a deep basin, over the lower edge of which the crystal water went rippling away through the thicket.  \"We'll put our tent right here,\" said Charley, indicating a level spot beside the spring basin. \"We'll have to clear away some of the bushes to make room for it. We can use what we cut as a screen, though nobody would ever see a tent away in here, especially one of brown khaki, like ours.\"  He drew his little axe and began clearing a space for the tent, cutting the rhododendron stems a little below the surface of the ground. Lew piled the branches at one side. Then the tent was dragged in and set up, the rope being used as a ridge and tied to two strong saplings. The sides of the tent were squared and pegged down.  \"Drive the pegs tight, Lew,\" directed Charley. \"We don't want to have anything crawling under the sides. Thank goodness, we have a sod cloth.\"  After they had completed this task and set about bringing in the duffel, Charley remarked, \"We can't go in and out this way, on our hands and knees. We've got to make a path. We'll find the best way out and trim the bushes so that we can walk upright.\"  \"We'd better not make the path straight,\" said Lew. \"If we zigzag it, nobody will know it really is a path.\"  After they had picked out a level route they trimmed back the rhododendron branches so that they could walk through the thicket, though the branches at the very edge were left undisturbed. The cut branches were added to the screen about the tent. Then the duffel was carried in and stowed in the tent.  \"What bothers me,\" said Charley, \"is to know how to put up our aerial. We don't dare hang it up where it can be seen, and I don't know how well it will work among these hemlocks.\"  \"All we can do is to put it up and try it,\" said the ever practical Lew, \"and the sooner we do it the better.\"  Quickly they had their wires suspended between two hemlock trees. The aerial reached almost from trunk to trunk, and the wires were completely hidden by the branches that stood out all about them.  \"If she'll work,\" commented Charley, \"it's a peach of an arrangement. Nobody would discover that aerial in a hundred years. I can hardly wait until evening to test it out.\"  \"Willie might be listening in,\" he explained, as the sparks began to leap between the points of his spark-gap.  \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he rapped out. (Camp Brady Wireless Club, Charley Russell calling.)  Then he sat in silence, waiting for an answer. It came promptly.  \"CBC--CBC--CBC--I--I--I--GA.\" (Charley Russell--We're here. Go ahead.)  \"Got 'em,\" he cried. He answered and got a reply. \"They want to know why we didn't call up last night,\" Charley said to Lew.  The fire in the little fireplace burned clear and bright, making a circle of light in the dark forest. Lew sat near the fire, cross-legged on his pack bag, thrusting an occasional stick into the flames. Charley sat by his instrument. Rapidly he pressed the key, and the sparks flew between the points of his gap like tiny flashes of horizontal lightning.  \"Hello! Is that you, Willie?\" rapped out Charley.  \"Sure,\" came the answer. \"But we're all here. Why didn't you call up last night?\"  \"Couldn't,\" answered Charley. \"Didn't reach Old Ironsides camp site until long after dark. Forest fires have burned up all the timber there. Spring dried up, too. Had terrible time. Awful thirsty and no water to drink. Too tired to put up aerial.\"  \"Where are you now?\"  \"In the third valley east of Old Ironsides. Never been so far in the mountains before. Grand stand of timber here. Great trout stream. Full of big ones. Won't touch worms or flies. Just been catching crabs to try to-morrow.\"  \"Get any yet?\"  \"One big one.\"  \"Have any adventures?\"  \"Not unless you call our experience in the burned timber an adventure. Toughest thing I've stacked up against in a long time. Timber burned for miles. No fish. Raccoons catching 'em out of the little pools. Had to come here to get any. What are you doing?\"  \"Everybody hard at work. I got a new job yesterday helping a fellow make a wireless outfit.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Right here. We're making it in my shop.\"  \"Will you be there to-morrow?\"  \"Sure. All day.\"  \"We'll call you.\"  \"Good! I'll listen in every hour on the hour. Then you can get me almost any time.\"  \"Bully for you. We're going to fish to-morrow, but we may catch so many in the morning that we won't want to fish after dinner. I'll let you know how we make out. Good luck to you all. Wish you were here. We'll bring you a nice mess of fish, anyway. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night and good luck.\"  \"I wish they were here,\" said Lew, as Charley covered the instruments to protect them from dampness, and moved over near his chum. \"It doesn't seem right to be in the forest without the whole crowd. This makes me think of our camp in the forest near the Elk City reservoir, when we were hot on the trail of the dynamiters. I'd hate to camp out at this time of year without any fire.\"  \"Well, let's turn in. We want to get up early to-morrow and try those crabs. I'll bet we get a bunch of trout.\"  \"Bet we do, too,\" replied Charley.  Little did he dream that on the morrow he would be engaged in matters far more serious than catching trout.     Chapter VII  The Forest Afire    The earliest rays of light had hardly penetrated beneath the giant pines the next morning before the two boys were astir. Their breakfast was quickly cooked and eaten. Then they buckled on their bait boxes and started. \"I don't see any way to cross now and there's no time to hunt for a way.\"  \"It's full of 'em. I'll bet on that,\" smiled Charley. \"We'll catch a mess in no time. Here goes with a worm.\"  He threaded one on his hook, crouched down, and cautiously drew near the bank. A dexterous flick of his rod landed the worm fairly in the middle of the run. Hardly had it hit the water before something grabbed it, and Charley drew forth a flopping fish. But it proved to be only a fingerling. In disgust Charley wet his hand and carefully unhooked the little fish.  \"Shows they're here, anyway,\" he said, as he tossed the little trout back into the stream.  But if they were there, they were strangely shy in making their presence known. Rod after rod the hoys advanced, careful not to show themselves, making their casts with greatest caution, and keeping as quiet as possible. But no fish so much as smelled their bait. Again and again they let their hooks float down into promising pools, but never a strike resulted.  They took the worms from their hooks and tried flies. But though their gaudy lures landed lightly on the water and danced in the rapids like real insects struggling for their lives, never a fish rose to grasp one.  \"They won't touch worms and they don't want flies. I wonder what they do like,\" grumbled Lew in disgust. \"I wish we had some grasshoppers or crickets. Bet we'd get 'em then.\"  They continued their efforts until it was almost dark. \"We'll have to be getting back to camp,\" said Charley. \"We can't see much longer. We don't want to be caught here in the dark. The flash-light is back at camp.\"  \"Here's a fat grub,\" said Lew, picking up a whiteworm out of a rotting log. \"I'm going to make one more try. Maybe they want grubs.\"  He slipped the worm on his hook and flicked it toward the brook. A second after it struck the water there was a splash, and Lew's reel sang shrilly.  \"Oh boy!\" cried Lew, as he struck up his rod smartly. \"I've got him.\"  He had. The fish leaped clear of the water, but failed to loosen the line. Then it darted away like a shot, the line cutting through the water with a sharp, swishing sound.  \"Hold him,\" called Charley. \"He's heading for that snag.\"  Lew put his thumb on the line and raised the tip of his rod higher. Under the tension the supple steel bent almost double. The fish stopped his rush, turned, and darted down-stream before Lew could reel in a foot of line.  Charley forgot all about his own fishing in his desire to help land the trout. \"Don't let him get under that rock,\" he warned, coming close to the brook. \"He'll cut the line.\"  Lew increased the tension on the line and the fish stopped short of the rock. For an instant the trout sulked and Lew reeled in rapidly.  \"Guess I got him,\" he cried triumphantly, as the fish was drawn near to the bank. But as he bent to grasp his prize there was a tremendous splash. The trout leaped high out of water, then darted off again like a flash. Lew had to give him line or lose him.  \"He's a whopper, Charley,\" he cried. \"Gee! I hope I don't lose him!\"  \"Here's a shallow place,\" cried Charley. \"Work him into it and we can grab him.\"  Lew maneuvered the trout toward the shoal. Again and again the fish broke for the deeper water and Lew had to give him line. But each time he stopped the rush and patiently worked the fish back toward the shoal. At last the trout was fairly on the edge of it. Lew began to pull steadily on his line and slid the tired fish into shallow water. It flopped helplessly on the stones. Lew drew it to the bank and thrust a finger into its gills. In another second the fish was dangling in air.  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" cried Charley excitedly. \"Ain't he a beaut! He's the biggest trout I ever saw.\"  \"He's the biggest one I ever caught,\" answered Lew. \"He'll make a meal himself.\"  \"He'll have to,\" returned Charley. \"We can't fish another minute. It's almost dark now.\"  Lew slipped his finger down the throat of the gasping fish, and bent the creature's head sharply back. The trout hung limp in his hand. Then the two fishermen made their way through the dusky forest to their camp, where Charley lighted a fire.  \"I'll just see what this fellow has been eating,\" said Lew. \"Maybe we can find out what sort of bait to use.\" He opened his knife and slit the fish's belly. \"Crabs!\" he cried, as his knife blade turned up the remains of a crayfish. \"Now we know what they want.\"  Soon Charley had a good bed of coals. Lew, meantime, cleaned the fish. Quickly it was cooked and eaten and the dishes washed. By this time it was altogether dark.  \"Now we'll get some crabs for to-morrow,\" said Lew.  \"Wonder how we can catch them?\" queried Charley.  \"What we need is a little dip-net. With that and the flash-light we could get a peck of them. These little streams are full of them.\"  \"Let's try scooping them with a coffee-pot. The lid comes off. If we are careful, I believe it will answer.\"  They took the lid off of the pot, and stepping to the brook turned the beam from their flash-light on the bottom of the run. The scene was fascinating. Feeling secure in the darkness, the living creatures in the brook had ventured abroad freely. Where the bright light of the sun would have disclosed only stones and sand, the little beam from the search-light revealed a myriad of moving shapes. Little minnows moved about in schools. Salamanders, large and small, crawled about among the rocks. Occasional trout were visible, lurking in the deeper holes, lying as motionless as sticks, or moving their tails slowly. Eels lay on the sandy spots. And lying still or crawling slowly among the stones were many crayfish. The water seemed to be filled with living objects.  \"Gee whiz!\" whispered Charley. \"It's like going to an aquarium and looking at the fish in glass cages. I never dreamed a brook could be so interesting.\"  With the utmost caution they moved along the bank of the run, looking for crayfish of suitable size. Whenever they found one, Charley focused the flash-light on it, moving the beam so as to dazzle the creature and keep the space behind it in darkness. And Lew would slip the coffee-pot into the water and move it cautiously up to the crayfish, ready for a final, quick scoop. Sometimes he was successful and sometimes the intended victim escaped. Always the click of the metal pot against the stony bottom sent the little creatures in the water scurrying for cover. A second after Lew tried for the crayfish not a living thing was visible. So it was necessary to move on along the stream. From spot to spot the two boys proceeded, now getting a good bait, now missing one, but ever keenly enjoying the wonderful glimpses of the life in the brook. So they continued until they had a goodly number of crayfish.  \"I believe that's enough,\" said Lew. \"Let's get back to camp. The fellows will be at their instruments at nine, ready to talk to us.\" He glanced at his watch. \"I had no idea,\" he cried, \"that it was so late. It's almost nine now. We'll have to hurry.\"  So fascinating had been the glimpses of life in the brook that time had sped much faster than either boy realized.  They hurried back to their camp. They had taken the precaution to sling their grub high above ground on a piece of wire, but apparently nothing had tried to molest anything. Lew rekindled the fire in the little stone fireplace they had built and Charley uncovered the wireless instruments and sat down, watch in hand, beside them. The forester looked on with keenest interest. He no longer regarded the wireless outfit as a mere plaything. If the boys could do what they said they could, he saw what a help wireless communication might be in protecting the forest. He had always considered the telephone as about the last step that could be made in quick communication in the forest. But his telephone was miles away and he had to get to it before he could talk with his office. Here was a boy who could sit down anywhere and instantly talk to a wireless operator anywhere else within a reasonable distance--that is, he could, if all that Charley said was true. Of course the forester knew about radio-telegraphy, but he was like many other people who have not actually seen persons talk by wireless. It seemed as though it could hardly be.  But he was not to remain long in doubt. When the three-minute period had elapsed, Charley threw over his switch, and sent the bright sparks flashing between the points of his spark-gap.  \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he rapped out. (Camp Brady Wireless Club, Charley Russell calling.)  Then he sat in silence, waiting for an answer. It came promptly.  \"CBC--CBC--CBC--I--I--I--GA.\" (Charley Russell--We're here. Go ahead.)  \"Got 'em,\" he cried. He answered and got a reply. \"They want to know why we didn't call up last night,\" Charley said to Lew.  The fire in the little fireplace burned clear and bright, making a circle of light in the dark forest. Lew sat near the fire, cross-legged on his pack bag, thrusting an occasional stick into the flames. Charley sat by his instrument. Rapidly he pressed the key, and the sparks flew between the points of his gap like tiny flashes of horizontal lightning.  \"Hello! Is that you, Willie?\" rapped out Charley.  \"Sure,\" came the answer. \"But we're all here. Why didn't you call up last night?\"  \"Couldn't,\" answered Charley. \"Didn't reach Old Ironsides camp site until long after dark. Forest fires have burned up all the timber there. Spring dried up, too. Had terrible time. Awful thirsty and no water to drink. Too tired to put up aerial.\"  \"Where are you now?\"  \"In the third valley east of Old Ironsides; that the message is from the two boys he met yesterday; that we are trying to hold it. Ask what we shall do. I'll wait for his answer.\"  For what seemed an endless period of time, Charley waited. Seconds were like minutes. Minutes dragged like quarter hours. It seemed as though Willie would never answer. There was nothing for Charley to do but sit and wait. In his impatience he could hardly keep still. He could not take his mind from the fire. He could think of nothing but that roaring line of flame consuming the floor of the forest and destroying the young growths. Would Willie never get the forester? Must the entire woods burn before the forester knew of the fire? In his excitement Charley clasped and unclasped his hands and nervously swayed back and forth as he sat on the ground.  Suddenly he sat up as steady as a stone image. The wireless was beginning to speak.  \"Forester on wire now,\" came the message. \"Wants to know where you are and how Morton is.\"  Charley ticked off the information and waited for a reply. It came very soon. \"Will rush doctor and men. Come as far to meet me as you can.\"     Chapter XVIII  The First Clue to the Incendiary    Slowly Charley and his friend made their way along the fire trail toward the highway and safety, Charley assisting the ranger as much as possible. The latter began to suffer great pain in his arm and the limb started to swell. Meantime, the forester, with a physician and a helper, was racing at top speed to reach the ranger. At a pace utterly reckless he drove his car over the forest road, and the instant the rescue party arrived at the point where Charley and Mr. Morton would reach the highway, they plunged into the forest. Faster than he had ever raced to a forest fire, the forester sped along the trail, his companions striving doggedly to keep up with him. He was deep in the woods before he met Charley and the ranger.  With hand extended, the forester ran to his ranger. Their hands met in a tight clasp. \"How is it, Jim?\" asked the forester, with anxious eyes.  \"I'm all right,\" rejoined the ranger. \"I'll pull out of this all O.K. That snake got me right, though. If it hadn't been for Charley here, I don't know how I would have made out. He's as good as a doctor.\"  By this time the doctor himself had come up, puffing too hard for words. He nodded his head, clasped the ranger's hand, and with a single word of greeting quickly began an examination of the injured arm. \"How long ago did this happen?\" he puffed.  \"More than two hours ago,\" said the ranger.  \"You haven't kept these tight all that time, have you?\" and the doctor laid his finger on one of the cords around the ranger's arm.  \"No, sir. Charley had me loosen them, one at a time, every twenty minutes or so.\"  \"That was quite right. What else have you done?\"  When the ranger had told him in detail exactly how Charley had treated him, the doctor grunted, \"Confound it! Then what did you hustle me out here this way for? I thought you were at the point of death.\"  Charley was amazed and offended at what he considered the heartlessness of the physician. \"You don't understand,\" he protested. \"Mr. Morton was badly bitten, sir.\"  Charley was still more astonished when both the ranger and the forester burst out laughing. He looked from one to the other questioningly. It did not occur to him that this was merely the doctor's way of saying that Charley had handled the situation about as well as he could have done it himself. Evidently the forester did not propose to enlighten Charley, for all he said was, \"Don't let him worry you, Charley. He's just naturally lazy and a grouch. He doesn't like it because I made him hustle for once, and he's disappointed not to find Jim at the point of death. These doctors are strange animals, Charley. But with all their faults we love them still.\" And he slapped the physician affectionately on the shoulder.  Charley looked puzzled. But concluding that silence was the best course, he said no more. All this time the doctor was continuing his labors, and Charley was amazed at the dexterous way he did things.  For a moment he listened to the beating of the ranger's heart. Then, seemingly with a single motion of his knife, he slit the sleeve of the ranger's shirt. Another motion laid open the undershirt sleeve, disclosing the arm to the shoulder. The physician examined it closely. The arm was swelling fast. The physician opened his case and gave the ranger some medicine. \"Now we'll get to bed as soon as possible,\" he said, \"and rest for a few days.\"  Assisted by a man on either side of him, the ranger started for the waiting motor-car.  \"Mr. Marlin,\" said Charley, after the party had gone a few rods, \"this morning Mr. Morton brought out a little wireless set that Lew made for him, as well as my big battery. It's back where Mr. Morton was bitten. May I get it and set it up in the ranger's house? It will be a good opportunity for him to practice while he's at home. Mrs. Morton is learning to operate the wireless, too. It would mean so much to both of them and to the forest as well, if they could talk to each other by wireless.\"  \"How long will it take you to put it up, Charley?\"  \"Not very long, sir. Perhaps an hour or two.\"  \"I don't like to leave the forest until I find out what those scamps are up to.\"  They came to the camp. The pup was still in the tent, and everything seemed to be as it was when the two young patrols left in the morning.  \"Things seem to be all right,\" said Charley. \"We'll be a bit cautious and cook on the alcohol stove to-night.\"  But when he went to the spring for water, he gave a cry of dismay. In the soft ground by the spring basin was a footprint exactly like that they had traced so painfully in the other valley.     Chapter XV  The Telltale Thumb-Print    More serious than ever was the ranger's face when Charley showed him the telltale footprint.  \"It's bad!\" he said. \"Altogether bad! He's as cunning as a rat, that Bill Collins. But how he could ever discover a camp so well concealed as this one is, I don't know.\"  And with that the ranger fell into a brown study. Lew and Charley went on rapidly with their preparations for supper.  \"Here,\" called the ranger, noticing what they were about. \"Mr. Marlin sent this to you. I almost forgot about it.\" He reached into the capacious inner pocket of the hunting-coat he wore and drew forth a bulky package.  \"Beefsteak!\" cried Charley, opening the package. \"Oh boy! And enough for two meals. We're certainly obliged to you and Mr. Marlin both.\"  Meantime, the pup, neglected, fawned upon them and began to whine, when suddenly the ranger cried out, \"I've got it. It was the pup.\"  \"The pup?\" echoed Charley. \"What about the pup?\"  \"Why, it was the pup that betrayed the camp. In some way those men got within hearing or smelling distance of this place, and the pup must have barked or whined. You know how a lonely dog will howl and carry on. I'm sorry, but I guess that pup will have to go, Charley.\"  Charley's face expressed almost as much mental agony as the pup's whine had shown, though he said nothing. The ranger, looking up, caught the expression, however, and understood. He knew how lonely it would be for Charley after Lew returned to Central City. \"The harm's already done,\" he continued, \"and I suppose it never does any good to lock the stable after the horse is gone. You may keep your pup, Charley; but I do wish he was a dumb brute in fact as well as in name.\"  \"I can train him to be quiet,\" said Charley eagerly. \"I trained Judge Gordon's dogs to hunt and I can train this little fellow not to make a noise. If I could keep him, sir, I'd be mighty glad. He'll be a lot of company.\"  \"Keep your dog, noise or no noise,\" said the kindly ranger with determination. \"If you can really train him well, he'll do us a thousand times more good than he does harm. Now that I know Bill Collins is in these woods, I don't like the idea of leaving you here alone. You train that dog as fast as you can. Train him to warn you of the approach of strangers, and train him to fight, too--and to fight hard.\"  Again the ranger lapsed into silence. After a while he said, \"What puzzles me now is this: Should we move your camp to another place or leave it where it is? Bill Collins knows there is a camp here. He saw you two boys in the forest and he has probably seen no one else. He will likely infer that it is your camp. But he has no way of knowing that you are connected with the Forest Service they would never start a fire.\"  Charley looked almost startled. \"Why, it would be the worst sort of crime for a forest protector to set a fire in the woods,\" he cried.  \"Of course it would,\" replied the forester. \"But this is the situation. Lumley will never dare hang around in the forest, for he will know that every man in the Forest Service is looking for him. Then, too, he can't have much food with him.\"  \"Only what he took from me, I suspect.\"  \"That makes it certain that he must leave the forest soon. It's a good many miles from the lumber camp to this neighborhood, so the three fugitives must be traveling in this direction. If they keep on for fifteen or twenty miles further, they will come out of the mountains near Pleasantville or Maple Gap. They can board a train at either place. The state police already are watching both stations. If Lumley and his fellows went straight on after they started the fires, and Goodness knows they wouldn't hang around here, they could reach the railroad in six or eight hours. That means they would be there by this time. There is a train that reaches Pleasantville about eleven o'clock. They would have time to make it. I should not be at all surprised, when I get back to the office, to find a message saying that the police had caught them.\"  \"Let us hope you do,\" said Charley.  The forester smiled with approval. \"Come out-of-doors,\" he said, picking up a mattock. And he led the way to a bed of seedling spruces that had been heeled in the ground, and dug up two or three of them.  \"These ought to be lifted in small bunches and their roots puddled,\" he said, dipping the earth-covered roots in water to show how to puddle them. \"They should be planted thus.\" He struck his mattock sharply into the soil, bent it to one side, and in the hole thus opened thrust a tiny tree. Then he stepped on the ground close to the seedling and pressed the earth tight about it.  \"That's all there is to it,\" he said. \"Your crew will work in pairs, one man carrying the trees in a pail of water and inserting them in the ground, while the other man carries the mattock and opens the holes. The trees should be planted in straight rows and about four feet apart each way. You will have to go ahead of the crew and set up the line pole. Pick out some trees or saplings to sight by and you will have no trouble to keep your line straight.\"  \"Is that all?\"  \"You'll have to oversee the work, of course. Make sure the planting is done right, and watch your men. You will have to take whatever steps seem necessary to keep them working well and cheerfully. Sometimes it is a good thing to switch a man from one job to another. It rests him to use another set of muscles.\"  \"What else am I to do?\"  \"Day after to-morrow I want you to brush out the fire trails leading to your old camp. That is, you must start brushing them out. It will take several days. They are so overgrown now that they are a real menace to the forest. These trails were originally five feet wide. We took out all the roots and underground growths down to mineral soil. You must cut away all the brush that has grown in, chop it into short lengths, and pile it in little piles in the trail itself for burning on windless days. You must grub out the roots that have grown in, too. Really the entire trail ought to be grubbed again, but we can't do that now. You will have to assign men to cut brush, to pile it, and to grub up the roots. That's about all I can tell you.\"  \"It sounds very easy,\" said Charley, \"but I am willing to confess that handling these tough looking mountaineers is more than I counted on.\"  \"Are you going to quit so soon?\" asked the forester with scorn. \"I thought you had more stuff in you than that, Charley.\"  Charley turned red. \"Who said anything about quitting?\" he demanded. \"I only want to know what I am to do if I get into trouble with the men.\"  \"That's more than I can tell you. It's up to you as a ranger to find the ways to manage your men. But I can tell you this. It is always best to follow Mr. Roosevelt's plan and speak softly but carry a big stick. Be kind to the men. Be square with them. Play no favorites. Look after their interest. But don't let them loaf on the job. They expect to have to work, and they won't have much respect for a man who doesn't hold them to their task. After all, they are not very different from horses. They have to be driven if they are to work.\"  \"I suspect some of them will be hard to drive,\" said Charley, \"if the few I have seen hereabout are good samples.\"  \"It all depends upon how you get started with them. Don't let them get away with you. Let them know you are the boss. And remember this: as a ranger you have power to hire and fire these men. If it comes to a show-down, don't hesitate to fire a man. We're short-handed, but we can much better afford to lose a laborer than to have an entire crew spoiled.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Charley. \"It will be a whole lot more cheerful with a fire. We have a candle lantern that we intended to use, but a fellow just ought to have a fire when he's in camp.\"  As they began to discuss the work ahead of them, the ranger inquired, \"What instructions did Mr. Marlin give you?\"  \"He said that we should keep our connection with the department secret,\" said Charley, \"and if possible, avoid meeting any one. If we do bump into anybody, we are to pose as fishermen. He said you would give us detailed instructions.\"  \"Very well. First, about your outfit. Have you any firearms?\"  \"A light, high-powered rifle and a pistol.\"  \"You can't carry a rifle in the forest at this season without exciting suspicion. Leave your rifle here. Let me see your pistol? Have you another?\"  Charley handed him his pistol and said that he had no other.  \"Then take this,\" he said as he handed Charley his automatic. \"Let your chum carry your pistol. I'll get another at the office. It isn't likely that you will ever need to use a weapon in the forest. I have been a ranger for years and have never yet drawn one, but I never travel without one. You'll meet some pretty tough characters in the forest and sometime your life may depend on having your pistol. My advice is never to patrol without it. But keep it out of sight. Keep your badge out of sight, too. And since you are supposed to be nothing more than fishermen, you'll have to play the parts. Carry your rods and catch a few fish each day during the season.\"  \"Where are we to patrol, and what hours are we to observe?\"  \"You are especially employed to guard this virgin timber, though, of course, you must protect any part of the forest you happen to be in. Take some good hikes over the region right away and get acquainted with it. Use your map and, if possible, learn the region by heart. Then your map will mean something to you. Learn where the virgin timber lies. Keep a close watch on it, and on any fishermen or campers. I'll spend at least two days a week out here and you must report to me each time I am here. Meantime, you must report to the office every night the last thing before you turn in. The chief said you had a wireless and could do it. Maybe you can, but it beats me to know how.\"  \"We'll show you in a little while,\" smiled Charley as he glanced at his watch. \"Willie will be at his instrument in three minutes, sure,\" he said. \"He might even be there now.\"  He drew the pack bags from the wireless instruments and sat down on one pack bag. The other he flung to Lew. Then he slipped the receivers on his head, threw over his switch, and sent the bright sparks flashing between the points of his spark-gap.  \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he called, then paused to listen.  There was no response. An anxious look crept into his eyes. \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" again he called.  No answering signal sounded in his ear. His face went white. \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he rapped out. (Camp Brady Wireless Club, Charley Russell calling.)  Then he sat in silence, waiting for an answer. It came promptly.  \"CBC--CBC--CBC--I--I--I--GA.\" (Charley Russell--We're here. Go ahead.)  \"Got 'em,\" he cried. He answered and got a reply. \"They want to know why we didn't call up last night,\" Charley said to Lew.  The fire in the little fireplace burned clear and bright, making a circle of light in the dark forest. Lew sat near the fire, cross-legged on his pack bag, thrusting an occasional stick into the flames. Charley sat by his instrument. Rapidly he pressed the key, and the sparks flew between the points of his gap like tiny flashes of horizontal lightning.  \"Hello! Is that you, Willie?\" rapped out Charley.  \"Sure,\" came the answer. \"But we're all here. Why didn't you call up last night?\"  \"Couldn't,\" answered Charley. \"Didn't reach Old Ironsides camp site until long after dark. Forest fires have burned up all the timber there. Spring dried up, too. Had terrible time. Awful thirsty and no water to drink. Too tired to put up aerial.\"  \"Where are you now?\"  \"In the third valley east of Old Ironsides. Never been so far in the mountains before. Grand stand of timber here. Great trout stream. Full of big ones. Won't touch worms or flies. Just been catching crabs to try to-morrow.\"  \"Get any yet?\"  \"One big one.\"  \"Have any adventures?\"  \"Not unless you call our experience in the burned timber an adventure. Toughest thing I've stacked up against in a long time. Timber burned for miles. No fish. Raccoons catching 'em out of the little pools. Had to come here to get any. What are you doing?\"  \"Everybody hard at work. I got a new job yesterday helping a fellow make a wireless outfit.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Right here. We're making it in my shop.\"  \"Will you be there to-morrow?\"  \"Sure. All day.\"  \"We'll call you.\"  \"Good! I'll listen in every hour on the hour. Then you can get me almost any time.\"  \"Bully for you. We're going to fish to-morrow, but we may catch so many in the morning that we won't want to fish after dinner. I'll let you know how we make out. Good luck to you all. Wish you were here. We'll bring you a nice mess of fish, anyway. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night and good luck.\"  \"I wish they were here,\" said Lew, as Charley covered the instruments to protect them from dampness, and moved over near his chum. \"It doesn't seem right to be in the forest without the whole crowd. This makes me think of our camp in the forest near the Elk City reservoir, when we were hot on the trail of the dynamiters. I'd hate to camp out at this time of year without any fire.\"  \"Well, let's turn in. We want to get up early to-morrow and try those crabs. I'll bet we get a bunch of trout.\"  \"Bet we do, too,\" replied Charley.  Little did he dream that on the morrow he would be engaged in matters far more serious than catching trout.     Chapter VII  The Forest Afire    The earliest rays of light had hardly penetrated beneath the giant pines the next morning before the two boys were astir. Their breakfast was quickly cooked and eaten. Then they buckled on their bait boxes and started. \"I don't see any way to cross now and there's no time to hunt for a way.\"  \"It's full of 'em. I'll bet on that,\" smiled Charley. \"We'll catch a mess in no time. Here goes with a worm.\"  He threaded one on his hook, crouched down, and cautiously drew near the bank. A dexterous flick of his rod landed the worm fairly in the middle of the run. Hardly had it hit the water before something grabbed it, and Charley drew forth a flopping fish. But it proved to be only a fingerling. In disgust Charley wet his hand and carefully unhooked the little fish.  \"Shows they're here, anyway,\" he said, as he tossed the little trout back into the stream.  But if they were there, they were strangely shy in making their presence known. Rod after rod the hoys advanced, careful not to show themselves, making their casts with greatest caution, and keeping as quiet as possible. But no fish so much as smelled their bait. Again and again they let their hooks float down into promising pools, but never a strike resulted.  They took the worms from their hooks and tried flies. But though their gaudy lures landed lightly on the water and danced in the rapids like real insects struggling for their lives, never a fish rose to grasp one.  \"They won't touch worms and they don't want flies. I wonder what they do like,\" grumbled Lew in disgust. \"I wish we had some grasshoppers or crickets. Bet we'd get 'em then.\"  They continued their efforts until it was almost dark. \"We'll have to be getting back to camp,\" said Charley. \"We can't see much longer. We don't want to be caught here in the dark. The flash-light is back at camp.\"  \"Here's a fat grub,\" said Lew, picking up a whiteworm out of a rotting log. \"I'm going to make one more try. Maybe they want grubs.\"  He slipped the worm on his hook and flicked it toward the brook. A second after it struck the water there was a splash, and Lew's reel sang shrilly.  \"Oh boy!\" cried Lew, as he struck up his rod smartly. \"I've got him.\"  He had. The fish leaped clear of the water, but failed to loosen the line. Then it darted away like a shot, the line cutting through the water with a sharp, swishing sound.  \"Hold him,\" called Charley. \"He's heading for that snag.\"  Lew put his thumb on the line and raised the tip of his rod higher. Under the tension the supple steel bent almost double. The fish stopped his rush, turned, and darted down-stream before Lew could reel in a foot of line.  Charley forgot all about his own fishing in his desire to help land the trout. \"Don't let him get under that rock,\" he warned, coming close to the brook. \"He'll cut the line.\"  Lew increased the tension on the line and the fish stopped short of the rock. For an instant the trout sulked and Lew reeled in rapidly.  \"Guess I got him,\" he cried triumphantly, as the fish was drawn near to the bank. But as he bent to grasp his prize there was a tremendous splash. The trout leaped high out of water, then darted off again like a flash. Lew had to give him line or lose him.  \"He's a whopper, Charley,\" he cried. \"Gee! I hope I don't lose him!\"  \"Here's a shallow place,\" cried Charley. \"Work him into it and we can grab him.\"  Lew maneuvered the trout toward the shoal. Again and again the fish broke for the deeper water and Lew had to give him line. But each time he stopped the rush and patiently worked the fish back toward the shoal. At last the trout was fairly on the edge of it. Lew began to pull steadily on his line and slid the tired fish into shallow water. It flopped helplessly on the stones. Lew drew it to the bank and thrust a finger into its gills. In another second the fish was dangling in air.  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" cried Charley excitedly. \"Ain't he a beaut! He's the biggest trout I ever saw.\"  \"He's the biggest one I ever caught,\" answered Lew. \"He'll make a meal himself.\"  \"He'll have to,\" returned Charley. \"We can't fish another minute. It's almost dark now.\"  Lew slipped his finger down the throat of the gasping fish, and bent the creature's head sharply back. The trout hung limp in his hand. Then the two fishermen made their way through the dusky forest to their camp, where Charley lighted a fire.  \"I'll just see what this fellow has been eating,\" said Lew. \"Maybe we can find out what sort of an animal it was he got. I think I can pretty nearly point out the spot where he landed.\"  They started toward the point at which the fire started.  Walking rapidly, they arrived at the edge of the burned area in half an hour. Smoke was still rising from smouldering embers at various points in the burned area; but there was no danger to be feared, for everything inflammable about these embers had been consumed. Even should the wind fan them into a flame again they could do no harm, for there was nothing for them to feed upon. Along the entire edge of the burned area the fire crew had made sure there was a wide belt of ground in which no spark remained. Thus, though these glowing embers might continue to smoulder for hours, they could do no harm. The quantity of smoke arising was still considerable, but it did not shut off the vision as the dense clouds of smoke had done during the fire. So the onlookers could get a fair idea of the extent of the blaze.  The blackened area on which they looked, they were relieved to find, was not of great width, though it stretched from the edge of the brook on one side almost to the mountain on the other. Altogether, the fire had swept over not more than a hundred acres. Had it not been for the presence of the two boys, it might easily have destroyed thousands of acres. The fire had started in a cut-over tract just below the edge of the virgin timber. Had the morning proved windy, instead of calm, the flames would have gone racing into the big timber, with the chances good for a disastrous crown-fire, when the flames would have gone leaping from tree top to tree top, utterly consuming the forest, as the previous fires had destroyed the timber on Old Ironsides. A lucky combination of circumstances alone had prevented a holocaust.  Climbing upon a high rock, the forester searched for the point at which the fire had originated. Prom his pocket he drew some powerful field-glasses, and again and again swept his vision over the farther edge of the burned area. Presently he closed his glasses and leaped to the ground.  \"Come on,\" he said, and headed diagonally across the burned tract.  In a few minutes the three stood on the unburned forest floor on the farther side of the strip of black.  \"We must get our aerial up at once, Lew,\" said Charley. \"It's been three-fourths of an hour since we talked to Willie.\"  They glanced about, selected two suitable trees, and had the supporting wires attached to them in no time, with the aerial dangling aloft between the trees. It took only a moment more to couple up the instruments.  \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he rapped out anxiously. And without listening for a reply, he repeated the message frantically half a dozen times. Then a buzzing sounded in his ears. A look of relief came on his face. He sighed. Willie was acknowledging his call signal.  \"Good-morning,\" continued Willie. \"Caught any trout yet?\"  \"The forest is afire!\" flashed back Charley. \"Get the district forester on the telephone instantly. His headquarters are at Oakdale. Tell him the fire is in the third valley east of Old Ironsides. Never been so far in the mountains before. Grand stand of timber here. Great trout stream. Full of big ones. Won't touch worms or flies. Just been catching crabs to try to-morrow.\"  \"Get any yet?\"  \"One big one.\"  \"Have any adventures?\"  \"Not unless you call our experience in the burned timber an adventure. Toughest thing I've stacked up against in a long time. Timber burned for miles. No fish. Raccoons catching 'em out of the little pools. Had to come here to get any. What are you doing?\"  \"Everybody hard at work. I got a new job yesterday helping a fellow make a wireless outfit.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Right here. We're making it in my shop.\"  \"Will you be there to-morrow?\"  \"Sure. All day.\"  \"We'll call you.\"  \"Good! I'll listen in every hour on the hour. Then you can get me almost any time.\"  \"Bully for you. We're going to fish to-morrow, but we may catch so many in the morning that we won't want to fish after dinner. I'll let you know how we make out. Good luck to you all. Wish you were here. We'll bring you a nice mess of fish, anyway. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night and good luck.\"  \"I wish they were here,\" said Lew, as Charley covered the instruments to protect them from dampness, and moved over near his chum. \"It doesn't seem right to be in the forest without the whole crowd. This makes me think of our camp in the forest near the Elk City reservoir, when we were hot on the trail of the dynamiters. I'd hate to camp out at this time of year without any fire.\"  \"Well, let's turn in. We want to get up early to-morrow and try those crabs. I'll bet we get a bunch of trout.\"  \"Bet we do, too,\" replied Charley.  Little did he dream that on the morrow he would be engaged in matters far more serious than catching trout.

Their breakfast was quickly cooked and eaten. Then they buckled on their bait boxes and started. \"I don't see any way to cross now and there's no time to hunt for a way.\"  \"It's full of 'em. I'll bet on that,\" smiled Charley. \"We'll catch a mess in no time. Here goes with a worm.\"  He threaded one on his hook, crouched down, and cautiously drew near the bank. A dexterous flick of his rod landed the worm fairly in the middle of the run. Hardly had it hit the water before something grabbed it, and Charley drew forth a flopping fish. But it proved to be only a fingerling. In disgust Charley wet his hand and carefully unhooked the little fish.  \"Shows they're here, anyway,\" he said, as he tossed the little trout back into the stream.  But if they were there, they were strangely shy in making their presence known. Rod after rod the hoys advanced, careful not to show themselves, making their casts with greatest caution, and keeping as quiet as possible. But no fish so much as smelled their bait. Again and again they let their hooks float down into promising pools, but never a strike resulted.  They took the worms from their hooks and tried flies. But though their gaudy lures landed lightly on the water and danced in the rapids like real insects struggling for their lives, never a fish rose to grasp one.  \"They won't touch worms and they don't want flies. I wonder what they do like,\" grumbled Lew in disgust. \"I wish we had some grasshoppers or crickets. Bet we'd get 'em then.\"  They continued their efforts until it was almost dark. \"We'll have to be getting back to camp,\" said Charley. \"We can't see much longer. We don't want to be caught here in the dark. The flash-light is back at camp.\"  \"Here's a fat grub,\" said Lew, picking up a whiteworm out of a rotting log. \"I'm going to make one more try. Maybe they want grubs.\"  He slipped the worm on his hook and flicked it toward the brook. A second after it struck the water there was a splash, and Lew's reel sang shrilly.  \"Oh boy!\" cried Lew, as he struck up his rod smartly. \"I've got him.\"  He had. The fish leaped clear of the water, but failed to loosen the line. Then it darted away like a shot, the line cutting through the water with a sharp, swishing sound.  \"Hold him,\" called Charley. \"He's heading for that snag.\"  Lew put his thumb on the line and raised the tip of his rod higher. Under the tension the supple steel bent almost double. The fish stopped his rush, turned, and darted down-stream before Lew could reel in a foot of line.  Charley forgot all about his own fishing in his desire to help land the trout. \"Don't let him get under that rock,\" he warned, coming close to the brook. \"He'll cut the line.\"  Lew increased the tension on the line and the fish stopped short of the rock. For an instant the trout sulked and Lew reeled in rapidly.  \"Guess I got him,\" he cried triumphantly, as the fish was drawn near to the bank. But as he bent to grasp his prize there was a tremendous splash. The trout leaped high out of water, then darted off again like a flash. Lew had to give him line or lose him.  \"He's a whopper, Charley,\" he cried. \"Gee! I hope I don't lose him!\"  \"Here's a shallow place,\" cried Charley. \"Work him into it and we can grab him.\"  Lew maneuvered the trout toward the shoal. Again and again the fish broke for the deeper water and Lew had to give him line. But each time he stopped the rush and patiently worked the fish back toward the shoal. At last the trout was fairly on the edge of it. Lew began to pull steadily on his line and slid the tired fish into shallow water. It flopped helplessly on the stones. Lew drew it to the bank and thrust a finger into its gills. In another second the fish was dangling in air.  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" cried Charley excitedly. \"Ain't he a beaut! He's the biggest trout I ever saw.\"  \"He's the biggest one I ever caught,\" answered Lew. \"He'll make a meal himself.\"  \"He'll have to,\" returned Charley. \"We can't fish another minute. It's almost dark now.\"  Lew slipped his finger down the throat of the gasping fish, and bent the creature's head sharply back. The trout hung limp in his hand. Then the two fishermen made their way through the dusky forest to their camp, where Charley lighted a fire.  \"I'll just see what this fellow has been eating,\" said Lew. \"Maybe we can find out what sort of bait to use.\" He opened his knife and slit the fish's belly. \"Crabs!\" he cried, as his knife blade turned up the remains of a crayfish. \"Now we know what they want.\"  Soon Charley had a good bed of coals. Lew, meantime, cleaned the fish. Quickly it was cooked and eaten and the dishes washed. By this time it was altogether dark.  \"Now we'll get some crabs for to-morrow,\" said Lew.  \"Wonder how we can catch them?\" queried Charley.  \"What we need is a little dip-net. With that and the flash-light we could get a peck of them. These little streams are full of them.\"  \"Let's try scooping them with a coffee-pot. The lid comes off. If we are careful, I believe it will answer.\"  They took the lid off of the pot, and stepping to the brook turned the beam from their flash-light on the bottom of the run. The scene was fascinating. Feeling secure in the darkness, the living creatures in the brook had ventured abroad freely. Where the bright light of the sun would have disclosed only stones and sand, the little beam from the search-light revealed a myriad of moving shapes. Little minnows moved about in schools. Salamanders, large and small, crawled about among the rocks. Occasional trout were visible, lurking in the deeper holes, lying as motionless as sticks, or moving their tails slowly. Eels lay on the sandy spots. And lying still or crawling slowly among the stones were many crayfish. The water seemed to be filled with living objects.  \"Gee whiz!\" whispered Charley. \"It's like going to an aquarium and looking at the fish in glass cages. I never dreamed a brook could be so interesting.\"  With the utmost caution they moved along the bank of the run, looking for crayfish of suitable size. Whenever they found one, Charley focused the flash-light on it, moving the beam so as to dazzle the creature and keep the space behind it in darkness. And Lew would slip the coffee-pot into the water and move it cautiously up to the crayfish, ready for a final, quick scoop. Sometimes he was successful and sometimes the intended victim escaped. Always the click of the metal pot against the stony bottom sent the little creatures in the water scurrying for cover. A second after Lew tried for the crayfish not a living thing was visible. So it was necessary to move on along the stream. From spot to spot the two boys proceeded, now getting a good bait, now missing one, but ever keenly enjoying the wonderful glimpses of the life in the brook. So they continued until they had a goodly number of crayfish.  \"I believe that's enough,\" said Lew. \"Let's get back to camp. The fellows will be at their instruments at nine, ready to talk to us.\" He glanced at his watch. \"I had no idea,\" he cried, \"that it was so late. It's almost nine now. We'll have to hurry.\"  So fascinating had been the glimpses of life in the brook that time had sped much faster than either boy realized.  They hurried back to their camp. They had taken the precaution to sling their grub high above ground on a piece of wire, but apparently nothing had tried to molest anything. Lew rekindled the fire in the little stone fireplace they had built and Charley uncovered the wireless instruments and sat down, watch in hand, beside them. The forester looked on with keenest interest. He no longer regarded the wireless outfit as a mere plaything. If the boys could do what they said they could, he saw what a help wireless communication might be in protecting the forest. He had always considered the telephone as about the last step that could be made in quick communication in the forest. But his telephone was miles away and he had to get to it before he could talk with his office. Here was a boy who could sit down anywhere and instantly talk to a wireless operator anywhere else within a reasonable distance--that is, he could, if all that Charley said was true. Of course the forester knew about radio-telegraphy, but he was like many other people who have not actually seen persons talk by wireless. It seemed as though it could hardly be.  But he was not to remain long in doubt. When the three-minute period had elapsed, Charley threw over his switch, covered the instruments with the pack bags, and was off down the valley. He felt much refreshed by his rest. At a steady jog he made his way along the brook.  Now he found it difficult to breathe. Smoke was rolling through the forest in billows. Close by he heard the cries of terror-stricken animals. He came to the edge of the burned space beside the brook, where they had beaten out the flames. Here there was practically no smoke. He turned away from the run and followed the black edge of the burned area. He knew this would bring him to Lew, and he wanted to make sure that they had extinguished every spark in the distance they had covered. Only at one point did he find fire smouldering. He beat out the sparks and went on. He could see almost nothing. The smoke grew thicker and thicker. Through it he began to distinguish the red glare of the flames. Ever louder sounded the crackle of fire. From a low, humming sound it grew, as he drew near, into a subdued roar. Then all other sounds were lost in the greater tumult of the forest fire.  Now he came close to the flames. The heat was terrific. The smoke choked him. He could hardly breathe. The roar of the fire was terrifying. Hitherto he had felt no fear. Now a feeling of alarm suddenly seized him. What if Lew had been overcome by smoke and burned in his absence? The possibility had never occurred to him before.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he shouted at the top of his voice, and started along the line of the fire. There was no reply. At least Charley heard none.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he cried. \"Where are you?\"  But no voice answered through the smoke.  \"If he's down, I'll find him or die trying,\" muttered Charley to himself.  His face was grim and set as he started along the line of the fire. There was no reply. At least Charley heard none.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he cried. \"Where are you?\"  But no voice answered through the smoke.  \"If he's down, I'll find him or die trying,\" muttered Charley to himself.  His face was grim and set as he started along the line of the fire. There was no reply. At least Charley heard none.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he cried. \"Where are you?\"  But no voice answered through the smoke.  \"If he's down, I'll find him or die trying,\" muttered Charley to himself.  His face was grim and set as he started along the line of the fire. There was no reply. At least Charley heard none.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he cried. \"Where are you?\"  But no voice answered through the smoke.  \"If he's down, I'll find him or die trying,\" muttered Charley to himself. And the training of the pup began then and there. All the way home, through the wide valleys, over the mountain tops, and across the little streams, Charley worked with the pup, trying to teach him to be silent and to walk quietly at his heels. And though many, many subsequent lessons were necessary before the pup was even half trained, the work with the dog made Charley forget his loneliness. He arrived at his camp, which he found undisturbed, once more in his normal frame of mind.  What shortly followed was to send him to bed soon afterward as happy as the traditional lark. For when Charley got into touch with Lew by wireless at the appointed time, Lew told him that the Wireless Patrol had met him, Lew, at the station in a body, with the news that funds for the battery had all been earned and the battery ordered; and that when he had told them of Charley's situation, the club had voted unanimously and enthusiastically to send the battery to Charley for him to use as long as he needed it in the forest.  Furthermore, Lew informed him, Henry had been talking to the wireless men at the Frankfort station, and not only were they willing to work with him to protect the forest, but they were also sending an amplifier to Oakdale so that Charley would be sure to get their messages with the greatest distinctness. The battery would be forwarded as soon as it reached the Wireless Club and had been inspected, and the amplifier would go with it.  No wonder that Charley rolled up in his blankets, with shining eyes, careless alike of cats and Collinses. With the pup and the new battery he felt that he should indeed be in position to render efficient service to his forester and his ranger, both of whom he was coming to love, and to the grand old forest around him.     Chapter XVII  An Accident in the Wilderness    As though she also were pleased at Charley's good fortune, Dame Nature smiled her best in the days that immediately followed. The sun rose warm and grateful. The forest was instinct with the spirit of spring, of new-born life, of hope eternal. Wilderness birds sang in the branches. The brook babbled and gurgled and ran madly down the slope. The leaves overhead whispered of the new life that had come. All the forest animals seemed filled with the joy of living. And Charley was not a whit behind them. His whole being thrilled with happiness.  Now he could see matters in their true light; or if his vision were a trifle clouded, the clouds were tinged with rose instead of black, as they had been previously.  Charley thanked Providence that he was just where he was. In some respects an unusual boy, he was mentally no abler than many of his fellows. He possessed a trueness of vision and an understanding of things that were, however, unusual in a lad of his age. Always he had had to earn the things that he wanted. And always he had been able, within reason, to get what he desired. Early in life, therefore, he had come to understand that everything has its price, and that he who is willing to pay the price can get almost anything he wishes. So now, instead of bewailing the fact that he was where he was, as many another lad would have done under the circumstances, he rejoiced. He rejoiced because he had sense enough to understand that his opportunity was at hand, here in the forest, and now.  In another respect Charley was mature for his years. He had come to understand, at least in a measure, that real success is always won by long and persistent effort in a given direction. Like other boys, Charley had his dreams and cherished lofty ambitions. But the stern necessities of life, as he had lived it, had taught him that dreams seldom come true as the result of luck, but are realized most certainly through consistent effort. He did not want to go to work in the factory because he hated the dirt and the noise and the odors and the sense of being cooped up, like an animal in a pen. Now he had all the freedom in the world, and the opportunity had come to become well acquainted with the things that he loved--trees, flowers, ferns, birds, animals, and all the other gifts of nature.  When Charley looked abroad and realized that his opportunity had come, and come in such a delightful way, he could hardly keep from shouting in his happiness. Like the sensible lad he was, he immediately asked himself this question, \"What is the best thing for me to do first?\" He decided that he would go on with the training of his pup. All day, as he walked through the forest, he labored to teach the young dog to trot quietly at his heels, or to walk silently in front of him.  Charley's purpose, of course, was to have the dog always at hand, to give him warning of the approach of man or beast, and to fight for him, if necessary. That the pup should learn not to betray himself or his master, was equally needful. So Charley had the additional task of teaching the dog to be silent, excepting for a very low growl, upon the approach of other creatures. Charley thought of the Leatherstocking and his dog, and wondered how that dog had been trained so wonderfully.  Day after day the lessons continued. Charley had abundant opportunity to work with the pup, for the forest was full of creatures that constantly excited the young animal. The training required no end of patience: but Charley loved the dog and never wearied in his efforts. By the time he had completed his labors with the pup, his own shadow was hardly more constant and quiet than the dog.  Charley was elated one day when the dog signaled the approach of a fisherman by no more than the faintest sort of a bark, and then at command, came promptly to heel and remained there, silent and watchful. It was the pup's first test with human beings. The fisherman proved to be one of two who were making their way along the margin of the run. Charley and the dog remained quietly behind some bushes until the fishermen were out of sight and hearing. Then Charley praised his little pup and went on.  His efforts with the dog, however, did not prevent him from thinking of other matters. Day after day his mind returned to the problem of the forest fire and the piece of green pasteboard. Ever since he had found the telltale pile of ashes and the charred pasteboard beneath it, Charley had been turning the problem over in his mind. How he was to solve the puzzle he did not see. Somewhere, he felt sure, he had seen pasteboard like the charred piece now in possession of Mr. Morton; but when or where he had seen it, he had not the slightest recollection. How he was ever to find another piece like it, he could not imagine; for as a fire patrol he had neither time nor opportunity to mingle with people.  He could see just one possibility of success. Undoubtedly there was a great deal more of the green pasteboard in the world than had been contained in the burned box. Hence persons other than the incendiary must have some of that same pasteboard. Perhaps some of those persons might bring a bit of it into the forest. Campers and fishermen often brought food and other things into the woods in pasteboard boxes. So Charley resolved to examine carefully every camp he came to, and even to scrutinize the remains of camp fires. But day followed day and Charley found nothing to enlighten him.  One day when Charley was on his way to meet the ranger, he suddenly realized that he was away behind time. Charley hated the idea of being tardy, especially when he had no reason for being late. He had been training his dog, and his work with the pup had delayed him more than he realized. But with haste he could still reach the meeting-place on time.  At the fastest pace that he thought he could hold Charley set off. His daily hikes through the forest had rapidly made a good walker of him, and now he went along at a rate that would speedily have tired out most travelers. Sometimes, to rest himself by changing his gait, he went scout pace, walking fifty steps, then jogging fifty. He allowed nothing to hinder him or take his attention. When he reached the meeting-place it still lacked a few minutes of the appointed hour. Charley wanted to be as prompt as his ranger, and so the two boys were astir by the time the first streaks of light tinged the eastern skies.  It was still dark enough to risk a little blaze in their fireplace and the warmth was grateful, for the early morning air was chill enough. Breakfast was soon cooked and their camp put to rights. Then, taking their fishing-rods again, they set forth to patrol the forest. The pup was tied in the tent, lest he should get into trouble with a porcupine or some other creature of the forest, and so make them tardy for their appointment.  Their plan was to travel down their own valley for a distance, then pass through a gap to a fire trail in the next bottom, which would lead to other trails that would take them close to their destination. They had studied out their route carefully on the map, and they made their way with both speed and certainty.  For a long time nothing of moment happened to them. The sun came up bright and clear, flirting with the fleecy clouds in the sky, that now plunged the land in deep shadow and again drew aside so that the forest was bathed in golden sunlight. The earth sent forth fragrant exhalations. A gentle breeze lent a tonic quality to the atmosphere. The leaves sparkled with dew, and the stream in the bottom flashed in the sunlight, filling the woods with its sonorous babble. So inviting was the scene that despite their haste, the boys could not resist the temptation to drop their hooks in promising pools as they moved along. Without half trying, they accumulated a dozen fine trout. The smaller ones they carefully unhooked and threw back into the stream.  They passed through the gap in the mountain and started to cross the bottom to the fire trail. At the brook in the middle of the valley they paused to make one last cast in an especially inviting pool. At that moment two men came out of a near-by thicket. Both were smoking. They were equipped like fishermen, though they had no fish. They were rough looking, with hard faces. One of them had an ugly scar above his right eye and showed a mouthful of gold teeth when he took his cigar from his mouth, as he asked, \"What luck?\"  \"We've got a few,\" replied Charley, extending his creel for their inspection.  The man looked at the fish and swore savagely. \"These kids have fished the brook out,\" he growled. \"There's no use trying this stream. We'll have to go on to the next valley.\"  Charley was in a quandary. These men, with their cigars, were a menace to the forest. It made him nervous merely to look at the glowing tobacco and the careless way the men flicked the ashes about. He was almost panic-stricken at the idea of their passing into his own valley while he was absent. He did not know whether to tell them the truth about his fish or remain silent. But he remembered that his watch in that valley was supposed to be a secret one, and he said nothing. Afterward he was glad that he had remained silent.  \"Come on,\" said the man with the gold teeth. \"These kids have queered us here. We'll be moving.\"  As he started away he gave Charley such a savage look that it almost frightened Charley. It did worry and alarm him, for he could not help asking himself what he should do if he had to deal sternly with such a man. Even with Lew at his side, he felt fearful. Alone in the forest with such desperate-looking men, he knew that he would be helpless.  Then he remembered the automatic stowed in his hip pocket and felt relieved. Now he understood much better why the ranger had given it to him. The remembrance that he had this weapon stiffened his courage wonderfully. He determined that if gun-play ever became necessary, he would not be caught napping. At once he shifted the automatic to his coat pocket, where he could shoot without drawing the weapon, and where he could carry his hand without exciting suspicion.  \"Gee!\" whispered Lew, after the two men had passed out of hearing. \"I wouldn't care to meet that pair after dark.\"  \"What I am afraid of,\" said Charley, \"is that they will set the forest afire. They were mighty careless with their cigars. Will they be any more careful with the butts when they have finished their smoke? I don't know but what we ought to trail them. Yet we've got to meet Mr. Morton and I don't want to be tardy. I can't make up my mind what we ought to do.\"  After a moment's consideration, he unjointed his rod, and started off in the direction from which the men had come. \"We'll find Mr. Morton just as quick as we can,\" he said with decision, \"and tell him the situation. Meantime, we'll make sure those men didn't start any fires up to this point.\"  Charley's anxiety lent wings to his heels and he started at a rate of speed that would soon have winded both boys. At a protest from Lew, he dropped to a fast walk. With open fire trails before them, the chums advanced rapidly. Soon they were well up the slope of the next mountain. They turned and studied the country behind them with anxious eyes. But no smoke columns showed against the green of the forest and they went on with lighter hearts.  \"I'm certainly going to get a pair of good field-glasses,\" said Charley, \"though I don't know where the money's to come from any more than I know how I'll get my battery. But I just have to have both.\"  Their meeting-place with Mr. Morton was in the next valley. Charley glanced at his watch and threw over the switch.  \"Willie might be listening in again to-day,\" suggested Lew. \"It will take him several days to get that new outfit made. We'll try him on the hour.\"  \"Good idea, Lew.\" He looked at his watch. \"It's ten minutes to the hour now. If Willie is listening in, we'll soon know whether or not our aerial will work.\"  They began putting the tent in order, stowing the duffel in neat little piles. Just outside the tent Lew built a foundation for the alcohol stove, by leveling the earth and setting a flat stone for the stove to stand on. Meanwhile, Charley was stuffing the tick with dry leaves.  Exactly on the hour Lew sat down at the wireless key and sent a call signal flashing.  \"What's the matter?\" came back Henry's reply. \"Why did you cut off?\"  \"Wildcat,\" flashed back Charley. \"Just outside our camp. Smells our meat. Scares a fellow half to death when he cries out. Ranger says it may hang around for days. Wish you would send us some traps.\"  \"You'll bring them out on your next visit, won't you?\" said Charley, turning to Mr. Morton.  \"Bring what out?\" demanded the perplexed ranger.  \"Why, traps. I forgot that you couldn't read the message I was sending. I'm asking Henry for traps.\"  \"Tell him to send them along. Trapping will be better than shooting under the circumstances, but don't hesitate to use your gun if you need to.\"  Charley turned back to his instrument and asked Henry to rush the traps. He inquired about his fellows of the Wireless Patrol ever since. The difficulty would be to get the battery. Things cost so much now that I don't see how I could ever save enough to pay for it. You know I'll have to give Dad about all I earn.\"  \"I'm going to talk to the boys about it, Charley,\" said Lew. \"Maybe somebody can think of a way out. Gee! We ought to be able to do something, with Roy a regular steamship operator and Henry almost as good as a substitute government wireless man.\"  By this time they were well into the forest. They were climbing through a notch over the first range of mountains. When they reached the valley beyond, they had to turn to their left and go up the valley two or three miles, until they struck a fire trail. This trail led straight over the second mountain, which was really the knob at the head of the burned valley. It was on this knob that they had found the rude watch-tower after their meeting with the ranger, Mr. Morton. Beyond this knob they had still to traverse a wide valley and climb a third mountain before they reached their camp site. But there was a good fire trail almost the entire distance.  Traveling with such heavy packs on their backs, the two lads made but slow progress. Every little while they had to stop to rest. During one of these pauses they heard a low, whining sound.  \"Listen! What is that?\" asked Charley, who loved animals and was keenly sensitive to their sufferings. \"It sounds like a dog.\"  They stood motionless. Faint but distinct came the unmistakable cry of a dog in distress.  Charley dropped his pack instantly. \"There's a dog in trouble,\" he said, \"and we've got to help him.\"  He began to whistle. Then he called, \"Here, boy! Here, boy!\"  From somewhere ahead of them came a joyous bark, followed by a painful whine.  Charley picked up his pack. \"Come on,\" he said, and hastened toward the sound. But he did not go far. Soon he caught sight of a dog, painfully limping toward him. Charley ran up to the animal, which wagged its tail violently and barked with joy.  \"He's only a half grown pup,\" said Charley, noticing the big paws. \"Isn't he a fine young fellow?\"  The animal leaped up against Charley and licked his hand. \"Come here, boy,\" said Charley, taking the dog in his arms. \"Let's see what's wrong.\"  Charley began to examine the animal's paws. The dog submitted patiently. \"Nothing wrong with that one,\" commented Charley, dropping a fore paw.  But when he began to feel the other front foot the dog whined with pain. \"No wonder,\" said Charley with sympathy. \"Look here, Lew,\" and he pointed to an enormous thorn that had embedded itself in the paw.  \"Hold him tight while I take it out,\" said Charley as he drew forth his knife, opened the small blade, slit the skin slightly, and carefully dug the thorn out. The foot was festered and swollen. Charley squeezed out the pus.  \"Don't let him get that paw in the dirt,\" he said, and ran to his pack. He fished out the first-aid kit and got some absorbent cotton and a disinfectant. He wrapped a tiny bit of cotton around the end of a twig, wet it with water from the canteen and swabbed out the little wound. Then he soaked another bit of cotton with the disinfectant and stuffed it into the foot.  \"We'll let that stay there a while,\" he said.  \"The dog is probably lost. We'll keep him until we find his owner.\"  Relieved of the thorn, the little animal frisked about, limping but slightly. He fawned upon Charley and seemed to be trying to express his gratitude.  The two boys shouldered their packs again and started on. Charley whistled to the pup, but the call was unnecessary. The pup stuck to their heels as close as a sticking-plaster.  \"They say two's a company, but three's a crowd,\" laughed Charley, \"but I guess it doesn't apply to dogs.\"  \"You never can tell,\" replied Lew. \"A pup of that age may get you into all sorts of difficulty.\"  \"I'll take a chance on it,\" smiled Charley, as he bent and patted the dog.  They went on. For a long time they traveled in silence, the little dog trotting and frisking at their heels. From time to time they stopped to rest. Their packs were growing heavy and neither felt like talking. They settled to their tasks and plodded on. When they came to the fire trail, they turned to their right and went straight over the first mountain. The way was smooth enough, but the grade was very steep and it tested their endurance to the utmost. Every few minutes they were compelled to rest. Finally they topped the ridge and went down into the next valley.  The bottom here was very wide, for the mountains had drawn far apart. Apparently the valley soil was rich. It seemed to be deep and black, and the trees grew to massive size. Ordinarily the two boys would have taken keen enjoyment in the sight of such fine timber, but by this time they were too tired to care much about anything except reaching their destination.  At the foot of the last ridge they took a long rest. They were just starting on when Lew heard a peculiar little sound behind some bushes just off the fire trail. Curious to know what might have made the sound, he dropped his pack and went to investigate. Behind the bush he found a cunning, little black animal that did not seem to be at all afraid of him. He picked it up and rejoined his comrade.  \"Charley,\" he said. \"See what I have found. What is it?\"  \"It's a bear cub,\" said Charley. \"You had better leave it alone. If its mother came along, she might make it hot for us.\"  \"I'm going to keep it for a pet,\" said Lew. \"I knew a fellow who had a pet bear cub once and----\"  Lew never finished the sentence. A savage growl sounded close at hand and a great black animal came rushing through the bushes. Lew dropped the cub and took to his heels. The bear followed in hot pursuit. She was a great, clumsy, lumbering beast, and yet she got over the ground with astonishing speed. Lew ran as fast as he could, but the bear gained on him at every stride.  \"Climb a tree, Lew,\" cried Charley, slipping off his pack and starting to his chum's assistance. \"Be quick about it.\"  Lew headed for the first tree he saw that was small enough to climb. It was a little pole, a foot in diameter. The lowest branch was seven or eight feet above the ground. Lew raced toward it, gathered himself for a leap and sprang upward. He caught the limb and swung himself up with all possible speed. He was not a second too soon. As Lew's body shot upward, the bear rose on her hind feet, and the vicious swipe of her paw barely missed Lew's body. Lew drew himself erect and climbed upward a few feet, where he paused to look down at the bear.  Meantime, Charley was following the animal. He hadn't the slightest idea of what he should do. The law protected the bear at that season of the year and he did not know whether he would be justified in shooting her under the circumstances or not. And anyway, his rifle was back with his pack. He had his little axe on his hip, however, and he drew it from its sheath so that he would have it ready in case he had to use it.  The problem was settled for him, however, in a very unexpected manner. The little dog, which had been playing with a stick at some distance from the two boys, noticed Charley running and came tearing after him. Then he saw the bear and went after her at full speed. The instant the bear heard the dog, she turned to face him; then as quickly faced about again and started to climb the very tree in which Lew had taken refuge.  \"Get that dog away from here,\" yelled Lew in consternation, as he began to climb frantically toward the top of the tree.  Despite the seriousness of the situation, Charley burst into a roar of laughter. But a second appeal from his chum stifled his laughter. He grabbed the dog and started to carry it away. But he had not gone two rods before Lew called frantically for him to bring the dog back. Charley turned around and saw the bear climbing after Lew. As long as the dog was under the tree, the bear had paid no attention to Lew. But when Charley started away with the pup, the angry bear continued her pursuit. Charley returned the dog to the base of the tree.  \"Sick 'em,\" he cried. \"Catch 'em.\"  The little pup made a terrific clamor and the bear paid no further attention to Lew, who immediately began to look for a way out of his predicament. Within two or three feet of the base of the tree which he had climbed, a second tree had sprung up. But the two had grown away from each other, much like the sloping sides of the letter V. At first Lew thought he could cross over to the other tree, but a careful inspection showed him that this would be impossible. Down where the bear was he could have swung himself from one tree to the other; but the farther up the tree he was the farther he was from the other tree and the smaller the limbs were. And Lew was now as near the top of the tree as he dared to go. To try to leap from his present position to the other tree was not to be thought of. It would certainly mean a fall of thirty feet or more. And Lew did not dare come down nearer the bear, lest the animal should again try to claw him. There was no apparent way to get the bear out of the tree, and Lew knew that he could not stay up where he was indefinitely.  Charley tried to divert the bear's attention to himself by reaching up the tree with his axe and striking the trunk. The bear growled but made no attempt to reach Charley. Her attention was centred wholly on the dog. With her hair erect, her lips drawn back, her ears laid flat, and her massive claws ready to tear and rend, the beast presented such a fearful front that Charley did not dare take the dog away. One swipe of those paws, or one crunch of the great jaws might cripple Lew for life, or even kill him outright.  \"Keep perfectly quiet, Lew,\" said Charley, \"and maybe the bear will forget about you. She's terribly enraged at this pup.\"  Charley felt in his pocket and found a piece of strong cord. He knotted it around the pup's neck and tied the animal to the tree.  \"I hope that bear won't come down and kill him while I'm gone,\" he muttered to himself. To Lew he said, \"I've got an idea. I'm going to get the rope and see if I can lasso the bear from the other tree.\"  \"Sick 'em, pup,\" he cried, urging the little dog to make another frenzied outburst. And while the dog was making the valley ring with his clamor, Charley raced to his pack and got the coil of rope. Back he ran and hastily climbed the tree beside the one in which Lew and the bear were resting. The bear eyed him angrily, but kept her attention centred on the pup. Charley climbed to a point a little higher than the limb on which the bear rested. Quickly he fashioned a noose and got his rope ready for a throw. Then he realized that he could never make a successful cast among the limbs.  An idea came to him. Drawing his little axe, he quickly cut and trimmed a small limb, leaving a fork on the end of it. He put the noose on the forked end and cautiously extended the pole. All the while he was urging on the dog, which now began to jump up against the trunk of the tree. The bear more and more centred her attention on the yelping dog. Her hair bristled, and she growled continually. She bent her head down and got ready to deal the dog a savage blow if he came up the tree. Her posture could not have been better for Charley's purpose. Swiftly but quietly he extended the pole until the noose was just beyond the bear's nose, then lowered it swiftly and pulled back hard on the rope. Luck was with him. The bear, taken utterly by surprise, was fairly noosed before she saw the rope.  Charley's sharp jerk to tighten the lasso almost pulled the bear from her perch. She grasped the trunk of the tree with her paws to avoid falling, and that gave Charley an opportunity to tighten and secure his rope. To keep from falling, the bear had to maintain her hold on the tree. Thus she could not claw or bite the rope.  \"I've got her,\" shouted Charley.  It was true enough. In a moment he was almost sorry that he had her. For Lew could not reach the ground without climbing past the bear, and although the animal was caught by the neck, he dared not trust himself within reach of those fearful claws. It occurred to Charley that perhaps he could strangle the bear, or even pull her from the tree. He did not want to kill the animal lest he get into difficulty with the law and so incur the displeasure of his chief. Nor did he want to tumble her to the ground because that would certainly mean the breaking of his rope and the probable loss of part of it.  \"What are we going to do, Lew?\" he called.  \"There's a strong limb about four feet above her head,\" replied Lew, peering down through the branches. \"If you could get your rope over that, we could drop her to the ground and strangle her until she's about all in. Then we could cut the rope and beat it.\"  \"That sounds all right,\" said Charley, dubiously, \"and I guess we'll have to try it. I see nothing else to do.\"  Fortunately his rope was long. He had taken a turn or two around a limb before making his cast, and he now held the bear taut, with ease. The loose end dangled down the trunk.  \"I don't know about this,\" said Charley with a wry face. \"It isn't as simple as it looks. I'll have to unwind the rope from this limb and hold it with one hand while I throw the loose end with the other. I don't know whether I can do it or not. And how am I to get the end again?\"  \"Can't you catch it with your pole?\"  Charley looked at the pole. He had let go of it when he noosed the bear, but it had lodged in a branch within reach.  \"Here goes,\" he said. \"I'll try.\"  Cautiously he unwrapped one winding from the limb. Then bracing himself, and pulling hard so as to keep the line taut, he unloosed the second coil. The rope now hung free in his hand. The bear was not quiet for a moment. She had struggled constantly from the instant she was noosed. She continued to tug and pull at the rope. But she was at such a disadvantage that she could not put her full weight into her struggles. Nevertheless the strain on Charley's arm was terrific. To lessen the tension would give the bear more leeway and so make the strain still greater. And to hold the bear with one hand, while he cast his rope and got it in with the other, Charley at once saw was impossible.  \"I can't do it, Lew,\" panted Charley. \"She's nearly pulling my arm off.\"  He gathered up the rope and put it back over the limb, preparatory to taking a turn about the branch once more. While he was attempting to work the rope around the limb, the dog suddenly increased his clamor.  The bear gave a terrific, convulsive jerk on the rope and jerked it through Charley's hand. The sudden pull completely unbalanced him and he fell from the limb. But instantly he tightened his clutch on the slipping rope and in a second was dangling in air, frightened but safe. He slid to the ground, and drew the rope taut. Now he had the rope over a limb, as he wanted it, but the limb was on the wrong tree.  \"I'll try it, anyway,\" he said.  He tied the end of the rope about the trunk of the tree in which Lew and the bear rested.  \"I'm going to pull her off her perch, Lew,\" he cried. \"If I succeed, she'll swing over toward the other tree. I may be able to pull her up on her hind feet. Anyway, I think I can hold her, and if you come down as quick as you can, the two of us can certainly pull her up. Are you ready?\"  Lew came down the tree as far as he dared. \"I'll be with you the second she drops,\" he said. \"Pull!\"  Charley suddenly threw his entire weight on the rope. The bear, taken by surprise, was jerked clear of the limb. She dropped downward and then swung toward the other tree like an enormous pendulum. Lew slid down the tree like a flash and landed in a heap beside Charley. He was up in an instant, and, grabbing the rope, added his weight to Charley's. The bear was fairly on the ground, but almost straight under the limb over which the rope hung. She was clawing frantically at the noose.  \"Let's give a jerk,\" said Charley. \"Together--now!\"  They strained suddenly at the rope and the bear rose to her hind feet to ease the strain on her neck. Instantly they pulled in the slack.  \"We've got her now,\" cried Lew. \"Pull again!\"  Once more they strained at the rope. It tightened about the neck of the bear, shutting off her wind. She rose to her very tiptoes and the boys pulled in a little more slack.  \"We could choke her to death now,\" said Charley, \"but we mustn't. How are we going to get out of this?\"  \"Let's tie the rope fast and take our packs some distance away. She won't strangle for a while. Then we can come back and free her. I think she will not attack us, for she is too much afraid of the dog. We'll keep him on a leash and beat it the minute we get the rope.\"  \"But how are we going to get the rope?\" demanded Charley.  \"Gee! You've got me. Maybe we'll think of something while we're carrying the packs away.\"  The two boys got their packs and hurried along their route for some hundreds of yards. Then they laid their packs down and ran back. But Charley carried his rifle on the return trip.  The bear was still pawing at the rope when they got back. The hair on her neck was worn off by her violent struggles, and the skin was bleeding freely.  \"That bear will wear a collar on her neck for life,\" said Charley. \"If we ever see her again, we'll know her.\"  An idea came to him. \"I've got it,\" he said. \"I'll cut that rope with a bullet. You stand ready with the dog, and I'll be ready for a second shot, if necessary. We're not going to take a chance of being badly hurt, law or no law.\"  Lew untied the dog from the tree and held the leash with his left hand. Charley handed him the axe, and Lew stepped a little aside where he could use it, if necessary. But it was one thing to talk about cutting the rope with a bullet and another thing to do it, for the bear kept the rope in motion continually. Charley leveled his weapon and tried to get a bead on the rope. It seemed to him that the bear would never stand still. But the beast had nearly reached the limit of endurance. Her tongue was protruding from her mouth, her eyes seemed ready to pop from her head. She was gasping pitifully. Her own struggles were slowly strangling her. Suddenly she stopped fighting and hung limp. The rope stretched like a rod. Instantly Charley's rifle cracked. The line was severed as though some one had cut it with a sword. It flew upward into the tree and the bear dropped to the ground. The noose about her neck came loose and she breathed freely.  \"Quick!\" cried Lew. \"She'll be on her feet in a second.\"  Charley untied the rope from the tree, drew the severed end to earth, and gathering up rope and rifle, fled toward his pack, with Lew at his heels, dragging the frantic dog by main force, for the animal was wild to charge the fallen bear.  As they ran, they glanced back over their shoulders. At first the bear did not move. Then she stirred uneasily and a second later, rose to her feet and ran madly away. The boys stopped running.  \"I guess both parties had a lesson,\" said Lew.     Chapter XI  The Secret Camp in the Wilderness    Their encounter with the bear made the two lads forget for a while their weariness. They made fast time along the fire trails. After a long tramp, they topped the final ridge and paused to rest and study the country. This they could do with ease, for the summit of the mountain was rather sparsely timbered. A very little search disclosed a tree that was at once tall and easy to climb, and that was surrounded only by low brush that would not obstruct the vision. From this lookout they gained a wide view in every direction.  \"We can see for miles and miles,\" said Charley. \"The forester was right in telling us to come often to this lookout. We can discover more from here in a minute than we could by a week of wandering about among the trees.\"  Slowly the boys swept their vision around the horizon. Everywhere the mountains appeared to bask in the warm spring sunlight, seemingly as secure as cats dozing by a fireplace. The fleecy clouds, passing across the face of the sun, threw shadows on the hillsides, making beautiful patterns of sun and shade. In the bottoms the night mist had gathered in little pools, in places completely blotting out the landscape. The tree tops, upthrusting through these banks of fog, looked like wooded islets in tiny gray lakes. In every direction the two boys scanned the country, looking sharply for slender spirals of smoke. But they saw only mist curling upward.  \"It looks to me,\" said Lew, \"as though mighty few people ever get into this valley. It's such a hard journey to get here that I suppose the fishermen will stop at the streams in the valleys nearer the highway, and nobody else would want to come here at this time of year. Unless this timber is set afire purposely, I believe there is not much danger of its being burned.\"  \"There's just the rub,\" replied Charley. \"It would naturally be safe, being so hard to get to, and for that reason it wouldn't be watched as well as more accessible regions, particularly when it is difficult to get fire patrols. But because some one is evidently trying to burn this particular stand of timber, it is especially necessary to guard it. Mr. Marlin wants it watched continually, but so secretly that no one will realize that it is being guarded. That might make the incendiary careless--providing he comes again--and so lead to his detection. We must do nothing to betray ourselves. We'll have to be careful not to mark this tree in any way, so that a passer-by would guess it was used as a watch-tower. And we shall have to be sure that we don't wear a path leading from it to our camp.\"  For many minutes the boys sat in the tree, well screened from observation by the spreading limbs, yet themselves able to see perfectly. In every direction they searched again and again for telltale columns of smoke, but saw nothing.  \"It looks to me,\" remarked Charley, \"as though there isn't a soul in this region except ourselves. If that is so, it is the best possible time to do a little exploring. Suppose we take a look at the valley above our camp. We can cover a lot of ground between now and noon and yet get back here for another observation during the dinner hour. We ought to be in this watch-tower or at some other point equally good every time men would naturally be having fires, and that means morning, noon, and night. Between times we can explore the forest. It means some pretty stiff hiking, but I guess we can stand it.\"  They drew their map and compared it with the country as it actually appeared.  \"We aren't so far from the end of the state land in this direction,\" commented Lew. \"That's the very place you suggested exploring. We might look up the line, as Mr. Morton suggested. You notice the stand of pines ends a long distance this side of the line. That's all hardwood forest up that way.\"  \"The sooner we get at it, the better,\" agreed Charley.  Carefully they descended the tree, picked up their fishing-rods, and hastened down the mountainside as fast as it was safe to travel. The nearer they came to the centre of the valley, the larger the trees grew. Evidently the rich soil had worked down into the bottom, during the centuries, and the tree growth was enormous. Under these huge trees there was no underbrush, and the two boys could make fast time. They approached the stream, which flowed swiftly along under the tall pines, where they had no doubt trout innumerable lurked in the shadowy depths. The temptation to stop and fish was strong, but they put it aside and pushed on up the valley.  For a long time they passed like ghosts among the pines. The earth was springy with the accumulated needles of many years, into which their feet sank silently. Under the huge trees everything seemed to be hushed. There was no wind to set the pines awhispering, and the music of the brook stole through the forest like the low singing of a muted violin string.  For a long distance they passed through a pure stand of pines. Then the character of the forest began to change. Soon they were in a mixed growth, and not long afterward they found practically nothing but deciduous trees about them.  \"We're not far from the line now,\" suggested Lew. \"This must be the stand of hardwoods we saw from the lookout tree. I doubt if it is more than half a mile to the line.\"  \"Keep your eyes open for blazed trees,\" said Charley. \"We ought to see some before many minutes.\"  They had gone on, perhaps a quarter of a mile, when Lew said, \"It looks pretty thin ahead. Either there is a natural opening in the forest or else the timber has been cut out.\"  Charley thought of what Mr. Morton had told him about timber thieves operating along the boundary lines. He was glad that he had decided to explore this particular section of his district. A moment later he was still more glad, for the stillness of the morning air was suddenly broken by a splitting, rending sound, which was followed by the crash of a great tree as it came thundering to earth. There could be no mistaking the sound. A tree had been felled. Both boys stopped dead in their tracks and looked questioningly at each other. Soon the whistle was repeated.  \"We've got to find out who's whistling,\" said Charley. \"Keep the pup quiet and I'll slip out and take a look.\"  He left the tent, but had hardly gone ten feet before a voice cried, \"Hello, Russell! Are you in the thicket? This is Morton, the ranger.\"  \"Sure we're here,\" replied Charley, an expression of relief coming on his face. \"We didn't know who it was and kept quiet until we could take a look. I'm coming out now.\"  He hurried from the thicket and shook hands warmly with the newcomer. Instinctively he knew that he was going to like his ranger. Big, broad-shouldered, quite evidently powerful, with a kindly expression, a winning smile, and a deep voice that instantly created confidence, the ranger was a picture of honest manhood. No one could look into his deep blue eyes, set far apart, or examine the lines on his face, at once betokening strength of character with gentleness, and not feel that here was a man in very truth. One knew instinctively that he would never hesitate a second to risk his life to save another's, and that he would be as gentle as a woman in his dealings with all creatures. But the great, strong jaw and the straight mouth and long nose all foretold fearless courage, and were ample warning that the man would be terrible if stirred to wrath.  \"Come in and see our camp,\" said Charley, after the two boys had surveyed the scene in silence. \"The forest is one of nature's very finest gifts. And to think what we do to it by our carelessness. At any minute this green paradise may become a very hell of roaring flame, just because some smoker is too careless to blow out his match before dropping it, or some camper too lazy to make sure his fire is extinguished. Why, it seems to me that a murderer is an innocent angel compared to such a man. Think what he does! He kills the fish and the birds and the animals and perhaps some human beings, and he destroys not only the wood that civilization must have, but he ruins the very ground so that it cannot produce another forest. It seems to me that a man who does that ought to be punished more severely than any mere murderer. Why, a murderer kills only a single being. The man who starts a forest fire kills countless living things. I tell you, Lew, it makes me mighty proud to have a part in protecting this grand forest.\"  The boys were silent, wrapped in thought, until Lew suddenly pointed to a dense growth of evergreens directly below them, and not very far down the ridge. \"That must be our camp site,\" he said. And both boys examined the spot with interest.  \"That must be it,\" said Charley. \"It's dense enough, goodness knows! And there is a little stream of water stealing out of the lower side of the thicket. So there is a spring in there. Let's go down and take a look at it.\"  They shouldered their packs, whistled the pup to their heels, and went down to the thicket. In a space not less than a hundred yards in diameter rhododendrons grew in indescribable density, while above them towered some huge hemlocks. The two boys came close to the thicket and peered into it. Even now, in the bright glare of the full sun, deep twilight reigned beneath the rhododendrons. Evidently they were growths of great age. Their stems were like young saplings. Their tops rose high and spread wide. And their branches were laced and interlaced and twisted and grown together so as to make a mass almost impenetrable.  \"Great Ned!\" cried Lew. \"A passer-by would have about as much chance of seeing us in there as we have of discovering China from this hillside. The question is, how are we going to get into the place?\"  Charley dropped on his hands and knees and crawled slowly under the low rhododendron branches.  \"Keep right in my tracks, Lew, if you come in,\" warned Charley. \"If there are any snakes in here, they'd bite a fellow before he could see them. I'll look sharp for them and if you follow me, you won't run any risk.\"  He picked up a fallen branch, trimmed it, and crept on, stick in hand. Suddenly he crowded back hard on Lew, almost kicking him in the face. At the same time he began to thrash about in the leaves ahead of him.  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" he exclaimed. \"I almost crawled on a big rattler. He was so near the color of the ground that I didn't see him until he coiled and raised his head. Gee! That was a close shave.\"  \"As long as you didn't get bitten,\" said Lew, \"It's a good thing it happened. We'll be on our guard now.\"  \"Yes, indeed. Did you put the potassium permanganate in the first-aid kit, and the hypodermic syringe?\"  \"Surest thing you know.\"  \"We'll just carry them with us, Lew. We won't take any chances on death by snake-bite. These mountains are full of rattlers and copperheads.\"  \"And we won't take any chances on being bitten in this thicket, either,\" answered Lew. \"We'll put the pup in ahead of us.\"  They whistled in the dog and sent him scouring through the thicket. But either there had been no more snakes within it or else all had fled, for the dog raced eagerly about but found nothing to alarm him.  Confidently the boys now pushed into the interior of the thicket. At the very heart of it lay the spring. It came bubbling up through pure, white sand, and had formed a deep basin, over the lower edge of which the crystal water went rippling away through the thicket.  \"We'll put our tent right here,\" said Charley, indicating a level spot beside the spring basin. \"We'll have to clear away some of the bushes to make room for it. We can use what we cut as a screen, though nobody would ever see a tent away in here, especially one of brown khaki, like ours.\"  He drew his little axe and began clearing a space for the tent, cutting the rhododendron stems a little below the surface of the ground. Lew piled the branches at one side. Then the tent was dragged in and set up, the rope being used as a ridge and tied to two strong saplings. The sides of the tent were squared and pegged down.  \"Drive the pegs tight, Lew,\" directed Charley. \"We don't want to have anything crawling under the sides. Thank goodness, we have a sod cloth.\"  After they had completed this task and set about bringing in the duffel, Charley remarked, \"We can't go in and out this way, on our hands and knees. We've got to make a path. We'll find the best way out and trim the bushes so that we can walk upright.\"  \"We'd better not make the path straight,\" said Lew. \"If we zigzag it, nobody will know it really is a path.\"  After they had picked out a level route they trimmed back the rhododendron branches so that they could walk through the thicket, though the branches at the very edge were left undisturbed. The cut branches were added to the screen about the tent. Then the duffel was carried in and stowed in the tent.  \"What bothers me,\" said Charley, \"is to know how to put up our aerial. We don't dare hang it up where it can be seen, and I don't know how well it will work among these hemlocks.\"  \"All we can do is to put it up and try it,\" said the ever practical Lew, \"and the sooner we do it the better.\"  Quickly they had their wires suspended between two hemlock trees. The aerial reached almost from trunk to trunk, and the wires were completely hidden by the branches that stood out all about them.  \"If she'll work,\" commented Charley, \"it's a peach of an arrangement. Nobody would discover that aerial in a hundred years. I can hardly wait until evening to test it out.\"  \"Willie might be listening in,\" he explained, as the sparks began to leap between the points of his spark-gap. Rapidly he adjusted the points until his instrument was giving a spark of maximum strength. Then he settled himself to the task ahead.  \"WXY--WXY--WXY--CBC,\" called Charley. (Frankfort Radio Station--Charley Russell calling.) Several times he repeated the call. Then he shut off his switch and sat in silence listening for a reply. None came.  \"They may be talking to somebody,\" he muttered. Again he called. \"WXY--WXY--WXY--CBC,\" he flashed again and again. Once more he sat quiet and listened. At first he got no reply. Then, clear as a bell on a frosty morning, a signal sounded in his ear: \"CBC--CBC--CBC--I--I--I.\" (Charley Russell--I'm here.)  Charley sighed with relief. \"He's all right,\" he muttered.  Then he filled his hat with water and sprinkled some on Lew's face. Lew's eyelids flickered. Then his eyes opened.  \"Where am I, Charley?\" he asked. \"What are you doing?\"  For a moment he lay still. Then suddenly he sat bolt upright.  \"I know now,\" he said. \"The forest is on fire. I was fighting it and you went to call help. Did you get Willie? And how did you find me? I guess I got too much smoke. I started for the brook. That's all I can remember. I'm all right now. We're going back.\"  He got to his feet, but at first had to be supported. Charley made him lie down again. In a few minutes his strength seemed to return to him. He got up.  \"I'm all right now, Charley,\" he insisted. \"I mightn't be awake yet if you hadn't thrown that water on my face. Thanks, old man.\"  Charley did not tell Lew how near to death he had been. Instead, he said, \"Are you sure you're strong enough to tackle that fire again?\"  \"Sure as shooting,\" nodded Lew.  \"Then come on. The fire has an awful start on us. The forester wants us to try to hold the header by back-firing.\"  As they started toward the blaze Lew said, \"We'll have to work some distance in advance of it. If only we had rakes we might conquer it even yet.\"  They made their way to a point well in front of the header. Then they cut sticks and made little bundles of them to use like rakes.  \"I'll clear away the leaves and you start the fire,\" directed Charley.  He began raking away the leaves, clearing a sort of path about two feet wide straight across the line of the advancing header. Lew lighted the leaves on the side of the cleared space toward the header, following close upon Charley's heels. From time to time he ran back along the cleared space to make sure the flames had not jumped across it. Wherever they had, he beat them out with his brush. On the other side of the cleared space the flames slowly worked their way toward the onrushing header, widening with every minute the barren area where the flames could find no fuel to feed upon.  Rod after rod Charley cleared a narrow lane and Lew kept close behind him with his torch. With amazing rapidity they extended their line.  \"If only we had the Wireless Patrol here,\" panted Lew, \"we'd lick this old fire to a frazzle.\"  On and on they went. To save their strength they exchanged tasks at intervals. Every few minutes they faced about and ran back over their line to make sure no flames had crossed the cleared space. The air was dense with smoke, but the heat from their back-fire was trifling in comparison with that of the main conflagration. The stand of timber grew thicker, breaking the force of the breeze more and more. Their back-fire ate its way into the wind much faster, and the real fire came on slower. It seemed to be getting farther and farther away.  \"We've passed the header,\" cried Charley exultantly. \"We ought to be able to hold the main fire.\"  They rested a moment, then went at their task with renewed hope and vigor. Rod after rod they cleared a path and fired the leaves on the windward side of this lane. Finally their line grew so long that they could no longer guard it properly.  \"If only we had half a dozen boys to patrol the line,\" sighed Lew. \"I'm afraid the flames will jump across somewhere. Then all we have done will be in vain.\"  \"We'll make a trip over the whole line,\" declared Charley, \"and be sure it's safe. Then we'll stop back-firing and beat out the flames again. It's the only sure way I can think of.\"  He drew his axe and cut fresh boughs. Then they went back along their line. In one place flames had already leaped across, but they fell on them vigorously with their bushes and soon put them out. They patrolled the line until they felt sure it was safe.  \"If we can put out the flames between our back-fire and the brook,\" said Lew, \"it will make our job a great deal easier. We've already put out part of them.\"  They began to work their way back to the brook, following the line of flame and beating out the fire foot by foot as they advanced. There were many things in their favor. The dense stand of trees at this point not only checked the wind and made the fire less fierce, but the absence of underbrush also helped to check it. There was little for it to feed upon but leaves. So the two boys could work close to it and beat it out with ease, though the smoke was stifling. Only lads of great determination and courage would have stuck to the task.  With frequent pauses, necessary for rest, they went on, foot by foot, yard after yard, rod upon rod. \"We're going to make it,\" cried Lew presently. \"It's only a little distance to the end of the flames.\"  They increased their efforts. Quickly they reached the end of the line of fire. In a few minutes more he reached the stream.  He laid his chum close beside the run, felt his pulse and listened to his breathing. Lew's heart was beating regularly and he was breathing easily.  Charley sighed with relief. \"He's all right,\" he muttered.  Then he filled his hat with water and sprinkled some on Lew's face. Lew's eyelids flickered. Then his eyes opened.  \"Where am I, Charley?\" he asked. \"What are you doing?\"  For a moment he lay still. Then suddenly he sat bolt upright.  \"I know now,\" he said. \"The forest is on fire. I was fighting it and you went to call help. Did you get Willie? And how did you find me? I guess I got too much smoke. I started for the brook. That's all I can remember. I'm all right now. We're going back.\"  He got to his feet, but at first had to be supported. Charley made him lie down again. In a few minutes his strength seemed to return to him. He got up.  \"I'm all right now, Charley,\" he insisted. \"I mightn't be awake yet if you hadn't thrown that water on my face. Thanks, old man.\"  Charley did not tell Lew how near to death he had been. Instead, he said, \"Are you sure you're strong enough to tackle that fire again?\"  \"Sure as shooting,\" nodded Lew.  \"Then come on. The fire has an awful start on us. The forester wants us to try to hold the header by back-firing.\"  As they started toward the blaze Lew said, \"We'll have to work some distance in advance of it. If only we had rakes we might conquer it even yet.\"  They made their way to a point well in front of the header. Then they cut sticks and made little bundles of them to use like rakes.  \"I'll clear away the leaves and you start the fire,\" directed Charley.  He began raking away the leaves, clearing a sort of path about two feet wide straight across the line of the advancing header.

With amazing rapidity they extended their line.  \"If only we had the Wireless Patrol here,\" panted Lew, \"we'd lick this old fire to a frazzle.\"  On and on they went. To save their strength they exchanged tasks at intervals. Every few minutes they faced about and ran back over their line to make sure no flames had crossed the cleared space. The air was dense with smoke, but the heat from their back-fire was trifling in comparison with that of the main conflagration. The stand of timber grew thicker, breaking the force of the breeze more and more. Their back-fire ate its way into the wind much faster, and the real fire came on slower. It seemed to be getting farther and farther away.  \"We've passed the header,\" cried Charley exultantly. \"We ought to be able to hold the main fire.\"  They rested a moment, then went at their task with renewed hope and vigor. Rod after rod they cleared a path and fired the leaves on the windward side of this lane. Finally their line grew so long that they could no longer guard it properly.  \"If only we had half a dozen boys to patrol the line,\" sighed Lew. \"I'm afraid the flames will jump across somewhere. Then all we have done will be in vain.\"  \"We'll make a trip over the whole line,\" declared Charley, \"and be sure it's safe. Then we'll stop back-firing and beat out the flames again. It's the only sure way I can think of.\"  He drew his axe and cut fresh boughs. Then they went back along their line. In one place flames had already leaped across, but they fell on them vigorously with their bushes and soon put them out. They patrolled the line until they felt sure it was safe.  \"If we can put out the flames between our back-fire and the brook,\" said Lew, \"it will make our job a great deal easier. We've already put out part of them.\"  They began to work their way back to the brook, following the line of flame and beating out the fire foot by foot as they advanced. There were many things in their favor. The dense stand of trees at this point not only checked the wind and made the fire less fierce, but the absence of underbrush also helped to check it. There was little for it to feed upon but leaves. So the two boys could work close to it and beat it out with ease, though the smoke was stifling. Only lads of great determination and courage would have stuck to the task.  With frequent pauses, necessary for rest, they went on, foot by foot, yard after yard, rod upon rod. \"We're going to make it,\" cried Lew presently. \"It's only a little distance to the end of the flames.\"  They increased their efforts. Quickly they reached the end of the line of fire. In a few minutes more he reached the stream.  He laid his chum close beside the run, felt his pulse and listened to his breathing. Lew's heart was beating regularly and he was breathing easily.  Charley sighed with relief. \"He's all right,\" he muttered.  Then he filled his hat with water and sprinkled some on Lew's face. Lew's eyelids flickered. Then his eyes opened.  \"Where am I, Charley?\" he asked. \"What are you doing?\"  For a moment he lay still. Then suddenly he sat bolt upright.  \"I know now,\" he said. \"The forest is on fire. I was fighting it and you went to call help. Did you get Willie? And how did you find me? I guess I got too much smoke. I started for the brook. That's all I can remember. I'm all right now. We're going back.\"  He got to his feet, but at first had to be supported. Charley made him lie down again. In a few minutes his strength seemed to return to him. He got up.  \"I'm all right now, Charley,\" he insisted. \"I mightn't be awake yet if you hadn't thrown that water on my face. Thanks, old man.\"  Charley did not tell Lew how near to death he had been. Instead, he said, \"Are you sure you're strong enough to tackle that fire again?\"  \"Sure as shooting,\" nodded Lew.  \"Then come on. The fire has an awful start on us. The forester wants us to try to hold the header by back-firing.\"  As they started toward the blaze Lew said, \"We'll have to work some distance in advance of it. If only we had rakes we might conquer it even yet.\"  They made their way to a point well in front of the header. Then they cut sticks and made little bundles of them to use like rakes.  \"I'll clear away the leaves and you start the fire,\" directed Charley.  He began raking away the leaves, clearing a sort of path about two feet wide straight across the line of the advancing header. Lew lighted the leaves on the side of the cleared space toward the header, following close upon Charley's heels. From time to time he ran back along the cleared space to make sure the flames had not jumped across it. Wherever they had, he beat them out with his brush. On the other side of the cleared space the flames slowly worked their way toward the onrushing header, widening with every minute the barren area where the flames could find no fuel to feed upon.

Quickly they reached the end of the line of fire. Beyond that the woods had been saved by their first efforts.  \"Now we'll go back over the line,\" said Charley, \"and make sure the fire doesn't start up anywhere.\"  \"I'm dying of thirst,\" said Lew. \"Let's get a drink first. We are not far from the brook.\"  They hurried to the run and threw themselves flat on the bank, drinking copious draughts of the cool and refreshing water.  \"I wonder what time it is,\" said Charley, as they got to their feet again. \"It seems to me that we've been fighting fire for hours.\" He looked at his watch. \"We have,\" he cried. \"It's after eleven o'clock. The fire crew has been on the way four hours. They'll follow their fire trails and get here in a fraction of the time it took us to come in. They certainly ought to be here soon. If we can hold the fire for a little bit longer the forest will be safe.\"  \"Come on,\" called Lew. \"We've got to do it.\"  Again they went along the line of their back-fire. For rod after rod the fire was conquered. In other places it still burned; but the back-fire had now eaten its way so far to windward of the cleared space that there was no longer any danger of the flames leaping past the barrier. So they covered the entire length of their line and found it safe.  When they reached the main fire again they began to beat it out with branches. Rod after rod they continued to work their way. But at best their progress was painfully slow.  \"Lew,\" said Charley of a sudden, \"while we are beating out these flames here, there may be another header in front of us traveling like a racehorse. I'm going to run ahead and see. You stay here. Call every little bit and I'll answer. I'll be back in a few minutes.\"  He made his way along the line of the fire. Here in the thick timber it still burned slowly and feebly. He could trace the line of fire far ahead, and it seemed to have advanced with remarkable evenness. Nowhere could be seen a header of flame jutting out far in advance of the main line.  \"If the wind doesn't rise,\" he muttered to himself, \"we're going to make it.\"  He went on, trying to locate the other end of the fire. Behind him he heard Lew halloing. Before he could turn to answer, an echo came back from the mountain in front of him.  \"If only that were a real voice,\" muttered Charley to himself. And the training of the pup began then and there. All the way home, through the wide valleys, over the mountain tops, and across the little streams, Charley worked with the pup, trying to teach him to be silent and to walk quietly at his heels. And though many, many subsequent lessons were necessary before the pup was even half trained, the work with the dog made Charley forget his loneliness. He arrived at his camp, which he found undisturbed, once more in his normal frame of mind.  What shortly followed was to send him to bed soon afterward as happy as the traditional lark. For when Charley got into touch with Lew by wireless at the appointed time, Lew told him that the Wireless Patrol had met him, Lew, at the station in a body, with the news that funds for the battery had all been earned and the battery ordered; and that when he had told them of Charley's situation, the club had voted unanimously and enthusiastically to send the battery to Charley for him to use as long as he needed it in the forest.  Furthermore, Lew informed him, Henry had been talking to the wireless men at the Frankfort station, and not only were they willing to work with him to protect the forest, but they were also sending an amplifier to Oakdale so that Charley would be sure to get their messages with the greatest distinctness. The battery would be forwarded as soon as it reached the Wireless Club and had been inspected, and the amplifier would go with it.  No wonder that Charley rolled up in his blankets, with shining eyes, careless alike of cats and Collinses. With the pup and the new battery he felt that he should indeed be in position to render efficient service to his forester and his ranger, both of whom he was coming to love, and to the grand old forest around him.     Chapter XVII  An Accident in the Wilderness    As though she also were pleased at Charley's good fortune, Dame Nature smiled her best in the days that immediately followed. The sun rose warm and grateful. The forest was instinct with the spirit of spring, of new-born life, of hope eternal. Wilderness birds sang in the branches. The brook babbled and gurgled and ran madly down the slope. The leaves overhead whispered of the new life that had come. All the forest animals seemed filled with the joy of living. And Charley was not a whit behind them. His whole being thrilled with happiness.  Now he could see matters in their true light; or if his vision were a trifle clouded, the clouds were tinged with rose instead of black, as they had been previously.  Charley thanked Providence that he was just where he was. In some respects an unusual boy, he was mentally no abler than many of his fellows. He possessed a trueness of vision and an understanding of things that were, however, unusual in a lad of his age. Always he had had to earn the things that he wanted. And always he had been able, within reason, to get what he desired. Early in life, therefore, he had come to understand that everything has its price, and that he who is willing to pay the price can get almost anything he wishes. So now, instead of bewailing the fact that he was where he was, as many another lad would have done under the circumstances, he rejoiced. He rejoiced because he had sense enough to understand that his opportunity was at hand, here in the forest, and now.  In another respect Charley was mature for his years. He had come to understand, at least in a measure, that real success is always won by long and persistent effort in a given direction. Like other boys, Charley had his dreams and cherished lofty ambitions. But the stern necessities of life, as he had lived it, had taught him that dreams seldom come true as the result of luck, but are realized most certainly through consistent effort. He did not want to go to work in the factory because he hated the dirt and the noise and the odors and the sense of being cooped up, like an animal in a pen. Now he had all the freedom in the world, and the opportunity had come to become well acquainted with the things that he loved--trees, flowers, ferns, birds, animals, and all the other gifts of nature.  When Charley looked abroad and realized that his opportunity had come, and come in such a delightful way, he could hardly keep from shouting in his happiness. Like the sensible lad he was, he immediately asked himself this question, \"What is the best thing for me to do first?\" He decided that he would go on with the training of his pup. All day, as he walked through the forest, he labored to teach the young dog to trot quietly at his heels, or to walk silently in front of him.  Charley's purpose, of course, was to have the dog always at hand, to give him warning of the approach of man or beast, and to fight for him, if necessary. That the pup should learn not to betray himself or his master, was equally needful. So Charley had the additional task of teaching the dog to be silent, excepting for a very low growl, upon the approach of other creatures. Charley thought of the Leatherstocking and his dog, and wondered how that dog had been trained so wonderfully.  Day after day the lessons continued. Charley had abundant opportunity to work with the pup, for the forest was full of creatures that constantly excited the young animal. The training required no end of patience: but Charley loved the dog and never wearied in his efforts. By the time he had completed his labors with the pup, his own shadow was hardly more constant and quiet than the dog.  Charley was elated one day when the dog signaled the approach of a fisherman by no more than the faintest sort of a bark, and then at command, came promptly to heel and remained there, silent and watchful. It was the pup's first test with human beings. The fisherman proved to be one of two who were making their way along the margin of the run. Charley and the dog remained quietly behind some bushes until the fishermen were out of sight and hearing. Then Charley praised his little pup and went on.  His efforts with the dog, however, did not prevent him from thinking of other matters. Day after day his mind returned to the problem of the forest fire and the piece of green pasteboard. Ever since he had found the telltale pile of ashes and the charred pasteboard beneath it, Charley had been turning the problem over in his mind. How he was to solve the puzzle he did not see. Somewhere, he felt sure, he had seen pasteboard like the charred piece now in possession of Mr. Morton; but when or where he had seen it, he had not the slightest recollection. How he was ever to find another piece like it, he could not imagine; for as a fire patrol he had neither time nor opportunity to mingle with people.  He could see just one possibility of success. Undoubtedly there was a great deal more of the green pasteboard in the world than had been contained in the burned box. Hence persons other than the incendiary must have some of that same pasteboard. Perhaps some of those persons might bring a bit of it into the forest. Campers and fishermen often brought food and other things into the woods in pasteboard boxes. So Charley resolved to examine carefully every camp he came to, and even to scrutinize the remains of camp fires. But day followed day and Charley found nothing to enlighten him.  One day when Charley was on his way to meet the ranger, he suddenly realized that he was away behind time. Charley hated the idea of being tardy, especially when he had no reason for being late. He had been training his dog, and his work with the pup had delayed him more than he realized. But with haste he could still reach the meeting-place on time.  At the fastest pace that he thought he could hold Charley set off. His daily hikes through the forest had rapidly made a good walker of him, and now he went along at a rate that would speedily have tired out most travelers. Sometimes, to rest himself by changing his gait, he went scout pace, walking fifty steps, then jogging fifty. He allowed nothing to hinder him or take his attention. When he reached the meeting-place it still lacked a few minutes of the appointed hour. Charley wanted to be as prompt as his ranger, and so the two boys were astir by the time the first streaks of light tinged the eastern skies.  It was still dark enough to risk a little blaze in their fireplace and the warmth was grateful, for the early morning air was chill enough. Breakfast was soon cooked and their camp put to rights. Then, taking their fishing-rods again, they set forth to patrol the forest. The pup was tied in the tent, lest he should get into trouble with a porcupine or some other creature of the forest, and so make them tardy for their appointment.  Their plan was to travel down their own valley for a distance, then pass through a gap to a fire trail in the next bottom, which would lead to other trails that would take them close to their destination. They had studied out their route carefully on the map, and they made their way with both speed and certainty.  For a long time nothing of moment happened to them. The sun came up bright and clear, flirting with the fleecy clouds in the sky, that now plunged the land in deep shadow and again drew aside so that the forest was bathed in golden sunlight. The earth sent forth fragrant exhalations. A gentle breeze lent a tonic quality to the atmosphere. The leaves sparkled with dew, and the stream in the bottom flashed in the sunlight, filling the woods with its sonorous babble. So inviting was the scene that despite their haste, the boys could not resist the temptation to drop their hooks in promising pools as they moved along. Without half trying, they accumulated a dozen fine trout. The smaller ones they carefully unhooked and threw back into the stream.  They passed through the gap in the mountain and started to cross the bottom to the fire trail. At the brook in the middle of the valley they paused to make one last cast in an especially inviting pool. At that moment two men came out of a near-by thicket. Both were smoking. They were equipped like fishermen, though they had no fish. They were rough looking, with hard faces. One of them had an ugly scar above his right eye and showed a mouthful of gold teeth when he took his cigar from his mouth, as he asked, \"What luck?\"  \"We've got a few,\" replied Charley, extending his creel for their inspection.  The man looked at the fish and swore savagely. \"These kids have fished the brook out,\" he growled. \"There's no use trying this stream. We'll have to go on to the next valley.\"  \"Is that all?\" laughed the ranger. \"I had come to believe that it weighed in the neighborhood of half a ton.\"  \"Did you really try to carry it?\" asked Charley.  \"Sure. The chief sent all your stuff as far as he could in the truck, and I packed it in as far as I could carry it. That's why I'm late. But I had to drop it a distance back. I brought these along, however, and thought we'd go back and get the battery, for I'm sure that's what it is.\" He paused and handed to Charley two pasteboard boxes he had strapped to his back. The larger one was bulky, but weighed comparatively little. The other was small.  \"I wonder what it is,\" said Charley, as he untied the string and opened the smaller box. \"The amplifier,\" he said. Then he opened the larger box.  \"Your wireless!\" he cried in delight. \"Everything is here, even to the aerial. Only the spreaders are lacking. We could make them and have this outfit set up in no time if we had to. Isn't it bully? Now we can talk directly with each other as soon as you learn to send and read. Won't that be dandy?\" With practiced eye he once more glanced over the outfit to make sure everything was there. Then he tied the box up again.  \"I'll just take it back with me,\" he added. \"This goes to your house, you know, and you can pick it up on your way home. We'll take it as far as the battery and leave it there.\"  They strode rapidly along the trail, and in half an hour reached the battery where the ranger had set it down. Some traps lay on top of the battery.  \"I forgot to bring them sooner,\" said the ranger.  Charley lifted the box. \"How in the world,\" he said, \"did you ever pack that thing over these mountains on your back? Why, you've carried that more than four miles.\"  \"We'll cut a couple of saplings and tie them to the box for handles,\" said the ranger. \"Then we can carry it easily. Give me your axe.\"  Charley handed his little axe to the ranger, and began to fumble in his pocket for the cord which he had used as a leash for his dog. The ranger looked around him for suitable poles. Close by the trail lay the rotting trunk of a large tree that had fallen years before. On the far side of this log and close to it some fine saplings had grown up, probably made thrifty by the rotting wood of the great tree. The ranger reached over the log to chop a sapling. At the same instant the pup, ranging in the bushes, growled savagely. Momentarily the ranger lifted his eyes, letting his axe head sink to the ground. Something moved under it, and at the same instant a hideous head reared itself above the leaves and struck with lightning-like rapidity, hitting the ranger just above the wrist-bone. With a startled exclamation the ranger drew up his arm. As he did so, a huge rattler glided away through the brush.  Charley turned at the ranger's cry. He comprehended the situation at a glance. \"Quick!\" he cried, springing to the ranger's side. \"Give me your arm.\"  He jerked back the ranger's sleeve, disclosing two dark spots on the back of the wrist where the fangs had punctured the skin. Drops of blood were oozing from them. Charley whipped out his knife and without hesitation drew the keen blade several times across the ranger's wrist. Blood began to flow down the hand. Putting his lips to the wound, Charley sucked out mouthful after mouthful of blood, which he spat on the ground.  \"Now squeeze your wrist tight just above the bite,\" said Charley. \"Stop the circulation of blood if you can.\"  Like a flash Charley picked up the dog leash and tied an end of it around the ranger's arm, close to the shoulder, drawing it so tight that the ranger winced. He cut the dangling end and took a second turn just above the ranger's elbow. Then he made a third turn half-way down the forearm. With little sticks he twisted the cords still tighter. Then he jerked out his hypodermic syringe, which he carried already filled with fluid, and thrusting the needle into the bleeding arm, injected the permanganate into the wound.  Meantime, the ranger stood silent, his face pale, his jaws set courageously. \"Where did you learn to do all that?\" he finally asked Charley, with evident admiration. \"You go about it like a doctor.\"  \"When the Wireless Patrol was in camp at Fort Brady, had given Charley a true estimate of the well-nigh irresistible fury of a fire in the forest, should conditions be favorable to the flames.  Only luck, Charley realized, and the best of luck, had brought him and Lew out victorious in their recent contest. The next time fire started--and he knew well enough that there would be a next time--there might be a strong wind, or to reach the blaze might take him hours, or he might not be able to summon help with his wireless, or other unfavorable conditions might arise to render his efforts useless. Then the forest would go roaring up in flame. And even though he might not have been unfaithful to his trust, the result would be the same. The timber would be destroyed. This great forest would be consumed. And he, especially selected to guard and protect it, would have failed. The thought was overwhelming.  More and more Charley turned to his wireless as a drowning man clutches at a straw. He saw that when Lew had gone and he had nothing but his own powers to depend upon, the wireless was going to be like a life-line to him. He realized that to have the powerful battery he wanted was imperative, if he was to have even a chance to make good in his efforts to protect the forest. And as he and Lew patrolled the timber, he made it evident to his chum what a vital part that battery would play in his success. But neither of them saw any way for Charley to come into immediate possession of it.  As the days passed and the forest still slumbered in safety, the sharp edge of Charley's anxiety wore off. That, too, was normal, for he could not naturally remain at such a pitch of emotion. So his interest in the life about him gradually returned. And indeed there were innumerable objects to interest a nature lover like Charley.  The country itself was enough to make a nature lover happy. When Charley climbed his watch tree and looked about, he could see nothing but forest. East, west, north, south, league upon league, far as the eye could see and much farther, stretched the forest, like a huge green sea. The mountains rose like great waves; and from his lofty perch Charley could see several parallel ridges rearing their crests aloft on either side of him. Distinctly he could see the two bottoms at the foot of the mountain on which stood his watch tree. Splendid stands of timber filled these valleys with swelling streams of water that flashed in the sunlight here and there through little openings in the trees. But what lay in the farther valleys he could only guess, though he knew that each must have its stream and some timber. What else there might be Charley did not know.  It was part of his work as a patrol to find out. And eagerly he looked forward to the daily hikes that would take him here or there or elsewhere in the great forest. Already he loved it; and he wanted to share all its secrets. Had Charley but known it, that very attitude of mind made him more valuable both to his ranger and to the forester. It meant that his work would not be done in a perfunctory manner, but with that genuine interest born of love that alone leads to perfect service.  The two chums made themselves familiar with their own valley from the border line of the state lands above the beaver dam, to a point many miles below their own camp. They found that they were in the heart of the stand of virgin timber, and that the location of their camp was by far the best that could have been chosen for the purpose of guarding the stand.  Charley thought it wonderful that the forester could offhand select such a strategic point. He felt more certain than ever that Mr. Marlin must have an intimate knowledge of the territory over which he had jurisdiction. Could Charley have known how intimate that knowledge was, he would have been amazed. And what he did not even guess was the fact that the forester had planned just such a secret watch on the big timber as Charley was now keeping, and that he had selected the camp site only after days of investigation.  Nor did Charley so much as dream that for some time Mr. Marlin had been looking about for some one he could trust to do the work. The native mountaineers did not command Mr. Marlin's entire confidence, nor did many of them possess the intelligence or education he desired in the man he selected.  Yet his sudden choice of Charley was characteristic of the forester. He always acted quickly when he thought the time for action had come. Charley's grit and pluck in voluntarily fighting the fire, coupled with his membership in the Wireless Patrol, were the factors that led Mr. Marlin to engage him at once. Had Charley known these facts, he might have felt a bit conceited or at least elated over the situation. But his belief was, as Mr. Marlin wished it to be, that the forester had taken him only as a last resort. And Charley was working hard to make good. He could hardly have taken a better way than the road he had chosen--to make himself familiar with all the territory he was to guard, and so to prepare himself for the emergencies that lay ahead of him.  Every day, and every hour of each day, the two boys found much that excited their wonder, for now they were studying nature at first-hand. Taking their dog, they one day climbed the mountain beyond the one on which their watch-tower stood, and came down into a lovely valley. But what instantly arrested their attention was the face of the mountain on the far side of this valley.  Instead of being a timbered slope, this mountain was a sheer precipice of rock that rose abruptly a thousand feet in air. Its rugged sides were seamed and scarred. Here and there a projecting ledge offered a scant foothold, but mostly the face of the cliff was one vast, frowning rock that rose almost perpendicularly. On tiny ledges and in crevices of the rock little ferns grew in masses, hanging down the face of the cliff like green fringes. Wild flowers had taken possession of the crannies. In precarious footholds, where it seemed impossible for them to exist, a few trees had sprung up, their roots crawling fantastically over the rocks in search of bits of earth to grow in, while the tops of the trees stood up slantingly against the face of the cliff. Mostly they were evergreens, and their scraggly branches made irregular dark masses on the face of the precipice.  As the two boys made their way toward the foot of this cliff, a great bird came soaring over the top of it, and sailed in lofty circles over the valley.  \"Look at that hawk!\" cried Lew. \"Isn't he a whopper? Look at the spread of his wings. And see how he soars, without ever moving a muscle. I wonder if he can see us.\"  Evidently the bird saw something, for suddenly it tilted downward, shot toward the earth like a flash, and was lost to sight behind the trees.  \"Whew!\" cried Charley. \"Did you see that drop? It almost took my breath away to watch him.\"  A moment later the bird rose into sight again, bearing in its talons a dark-colored animal of some sort. Though the animal was not large, it must have weighed many pounds. Yet the bird flew upward swiftly, lifting himself rapidly with strong strokes of its wings.  \"Gee whiz!\" exclaimed Charley, after watching the bird a moment. \"That's no hawk! That's an eagle. It's a bald eagle, too. See his white tail and head and the bare shanks?\"  \"Are you sure?\" demanded Lew. \"I've always wanted to see a bald eagle. It's our national emblem, you know.\"  \"I'm pretty sure that's one,\" replied Charley. \"I've read about them and seen pictures of their huts and their work, and that looks exactly like the pictures. And those noises like rifle-shots were their alarm signals. They slap the water with their tails when they are frightened and dive under water. I suppose they're all in their lodges now, and we'll never get a peep at them. Gee whiz! Just think of finding beavers, Lew, real beavers. I didn't know there were any in Pennsylvania.\"  \"It seems to me that I read something about the game commission stocking the state with them a few years ago. I think they put a number of them in the state forests. Doubtless they have multiplied in numbers and started new colonies.\"  \"That explains it,\" said Charley. \"Gee! I'm glad we found these fellows. And I'm just as glad that they aren't timber thieves. You know, Lew, it made me feel kind of queer to think of facing real timber thieves. I didn't like the idea a bit. But I kept thinking about Mr. Morton and what he said about his being blamed if I fell down, and I made up my mind I'd do it, no matter what happened.\"  They now turned their attention to the felled tree once more, studying the innumerable teeth marks, like so many tiny chisel cuts, on stump and butt. Then they noticed the great chips lying about the stump, some of them half as big as dinner plates.  \"It gets me to understand how they can bite out such huge chunks,\" said Lew, \"when their teeth are evidently so small. Why, you'd think an animal would have to have a mouth as big as a hippopotamus to take bites like these.\"  Charley laughed. \"Looks that way, doesn't it?\" he said. \"But as I remember it, what I read said that the beaver gnaws out parallel rings around the trunk and wrenches out the wood between. It's like sawing two cuts in a board and chiseling out the board between them.\"  \"I see,\" said Lew. \"But I should think they'd break their teeth all to pieces.\"  \"So should I. But they have very strong teeth that grow out as fast as they wear away, and that are as sharp as a chisel. I wouldn't want a beaver to bite me. I'll bet he could bite right through a bone.\"  \"I suppose,\" said Lew, \"they cut these trees to use in making their dam; but what gets me is how they are going to get the trees over to the dam. It would take a team of horses to drag this trunk. It's fifteen inches in diameter.\"  \"The article I read,\" said Charley, \"stated that as the beaver dams became higher, the land adjacent was flooded and that the beavers made little canals through the flooded area and floated their logs where they wanted them. You notice that they have gnawed the limbs off of a number of these trees and cut several of the trunks into lengths. I was sure they were sawlogs when I first saw them.\"  \"Well, there isn't enough water here to float a log,\" said Lew, \"though it's mighty wet and it looks as though the water was several inches deep a little farther on. Let's see if we can find a canal.\"  They stripped off their shoes and stockings, and, rolling up their trousers, began to wade. Very soon they found the water nearly knee-deep.  \"There's more water here than there seems to be,\" admitted Lew. \"There's so much marsh-grass and so many water-plants it fooled me.\"  Cautiously they waded about. Suddenly Lew plunged forward, and only by grasping a bush did he save himself from getting completely wet. As it was, he found himself standing upright in three feet of water. After he recovered from his surprise, he felt about with his feet.  \"This is their canal all right enough,\" he said. \"It's very narrow, but it will float anything that grows in this forest.\"  He scrambled out and the two boys made their way back to dry ground. \"How are you going to get dry?\" asked Charley. \"I don't want to make a fire unless it is absolutely necessary.\"  \"Never mind about me. I'll dry off soon enough. Let's find their dam.\"  They made their way toward the run and soon discovered the dam. It was a great pile of branches, stones, moss, grass, mud, bark, etc., that had been built across the stream and extended for rods on either side. It looked very solid, yet the water did not pour over it, but filtered through it.  \"Think of all the work it took to make that,\" cried Lew. \"Why, every stick in it had to be gnawed down and floated here, and all the bark and grass and roots had to be pulled and brought here and the stones collected. And say! How in the world do you suppose they ever handled those stones? And how do you suppose they ever anchored the stuff when they began building? I should think the current would have swept everything away at first. That's a pretty swift stream.\"  \"I read that they start their dams with saplings, which they anchor across the current with stones. They are much like squirrels, you know, and can use their fore paws about as well as we can use our hands. I suppose the stones lose weight by displacing water, but if I hadn't seen these rocks, I'd never have believed that such big stones could be handled by animals no larger than beavers.\"  \"See here,\" said Lew. \"These willow branches must have taken root, for they seem to be growing right up out of the top of the dam. And there's a birch that's surely growing. You know the branches of some trees will root if you put them in water, especially willows. Why, if they continue to grow and take more root, there'll be a hedge of living trees right across this brook. The dam will become so dense that it will back up a great quantity of water. I reckon this bottom will just naturally turn into a swamp after a time.\"  \"Now that's interesting,\" suggested Charley. \"You know the Bible tells us the world was made in six days; but it seems to me it isn't finished yet. Every rain washes down soil from the hills and helps to fill up the valleys and the river-bottoms, and the floods scour out the watercourses and carry earth and stones down to the ocean. And here we see a piece of land that used to be fine, dry bottom, now becoming a swamp. It looks to me as though the earth is changing every day.\"  They examined the dam more critically. \"It's two hundred feet wide if it's an inch,\" said Lew, \"though the brook isn't more than fifteen or twenty. You see, it extends on each side of the brook to land that is a little higher than the level of the stream bank. That's what makes this big head of water. At the least there are several acres of it.\"  \"There's one thing that we haven't seen yet,\" added Charley, \"and that's their houses. They ought to be some distance above the dam.\"  \"I wonder if those are beaver lodges,\" said Lew, pointing to some bulky heaps of brush at a little distance up-stream.  \"That's exactly what they are. They don't look much like houses, do they? But I guess they're pretty snug inside. The entrances are deep under water, you know, so that the ice can't clog them in winter, and so that the beavers can get to their food all right.\"  \"What do they eat, Charley? Do you know?\"  \"Sure. They eat roots, and tender plants, but mostly bark from certain trees. I believe these are willow, poplar, birch, and some others. They cut down the wood in summer and pile it under water in front of their huts and hold it down with stones.\"  \"Well, what do you think of that!\" cried Lew.  \"They eat a pile of it, too. I don't remember how many trees that article said a colony of beavers would eat in a winter, but I'm sure it was up in the hundreds. I remember how astonished I was when I read about it.\"  \"No wonder they clear the forest so fast. I wonder if we ought to tell Mr. Marlin. Maybe he doesn't know about these beavers. They might begin to cut down his virgin pines. I'm sure he wouldn't want that to happen.\"  Charley laughed. \"I'd bet my last dollar that Mr. Marlin knows all about these beavers. You can bank on it that he knows all there is to know about the territory he has charge of. And as for the beavers eating the pines, it seems to me that I read that they never touch evergreens.\"  A ray of sun slipped through the leaves above them and fell directly upon Charley's face. He glanced up and was surprised to note how high the sun had climbed. Then he looked at his watch.  \"Gee whiz!\" he cried. \"We must have been fooling around this beaver dam for more than an hour. We must be about our business. We'll go on and locate the boundary line.\"  \"I wish we could get a glimpse of a beaver,\" sighed Lew.  \"Not much use to wish it,\" said Charley. \"They're furtive, and I suppose they will stay in their lodges for hours. It seems to me I read that they work at their dams mostly at night. We'll go on now, but maybe we could come up here some moonlight evening and see them at work.\"  They made their way around the beaver dam and continued on up the valley. Within a few hundred yards they came upon a blazed tree. Speedily they discovered a second. Then, following the line indicated by these two trees, they rapidly passed tree after tree blazed and painted white, tracing the line entirely across the valley. They picked out some landmarks by which they could readily locate the line again.  \"If anybody except those beavers starts any timber cutting,\" said Charley, \"we'll know in a second whether he's cutting the state's wood or not. Now I guess we'd better hustle back to camp.\"  Lew got their noonday meal while Charley ascended once more to the watch tree at the top of the mountain and made a careful survey of the country. Not a sign of smoke could he see in any direction. No fire was discovered during the afternoon hike. The evening inspection from their tower was equally reassuring. After a brief chat by wireless with their friends at Central City, and through them sent a reassuring good-night to the forester. Then, too tired to listen to the night's news, they wrapped themselves in their blankets and were soon sound asleep.     Chapter XIV  The Trail in the Forest    The following day the two young patrols were to report to their ranger at the appointed place in the forest. Although the ranger had much farther to travel than they did, the boys knew from experience that he was afoot early during the fire season, and they felt certain he would be at the meeting-place before the appointed hour. Charley wanted to be as prompt as his ranger, and so the two boys were astir by the time the first streaks of light tinged the eastern skies.  It was still dark enough to risk a little blaze in their fireplace and the warmth was grateful, for the early morning air was chill enough. Breakfast was soon cooked and their camp put to rights. Then, taking their fishing-rods again, they set forth to patrol the forest. The pup was tied in the tent, lest he should get into trouble with a porcupine or some other creature of the forest, and so make them tardy for their appointment.  Their plan was to travel down their own valley for a distance, then pass through a gap to a fire trail in the next bottom, which would lead to other trails that would take them close to their destination. They had studied out their route carefully on the map, and they made their way with both speed and certainty.  For a long time nothing of moment happened to them. The sun came up bright and clear, flirting with the fleecy clouds in the sky, that now plunged the land in deep shadow and again drew aside so that the forest was bathed in golden sunlight. The earth sent forth fragrant exhalations. A gentle breeze lent a tonic quality to the atmosphere. The leaves sparkled with dew, and the stream in the bottom flashed in the sunlight, filling the woods with its sonorous babble. So inviting was the scene that despite their haste, the boys could not resist the temptation to drop their hooks in promising pools as they moved along. Without half trying, they accumulated a dozen fine trout. The smaller ones they carefully unhooked and threw back into the stream.  They passed through the gap in the mountain and started to cross the bottom to the fire trail. At the brook in the middle of the valley they paused to make one last cast in an especially inviting pool. At that moment two men came out of a near-by thicket. Both were smoking. They were equipped like fishermen, though they had no fish. They were rough looking, with hard faces. One of them had an ugly scar above his right eye and showed a mouthful of gold teeth when he took his cigar from his mouth, as he asked, \"What luck?\"  \"We've got a few,\" replied Charley, extending his creel for their inspection.  The man looked at the fish and swore savagely. \"These kids have fished the brook out,\" he growled. \"There's no use trying this stream. We'll have to go on to the next valley.\"  \"Is that all?\" laughed the ranger. \"I had come to believe that it weighed in the neighborhood of half a ton.\"  \"Did you really try to carry it?\" asked Charley.  \"Sure. The chief sent all your stuff as far as he could in the truck, and I packed it in as far as I could carry it. That's why I'm late. But I had to drop it a distance back. I brought these along, however, and thought we'd go back and get the battery, for I'm sure that's what it is.\" He paused and handed to Charley two pasteboard boxes he had strapped to his back. The larger one was bulky, but weighed comparatively little. The other was small.  \"I wonder what it is,\" said Charley, as he untied the string and opened the smaller box. \"The amplifier,\" he said. Then he opened the larger box.  \"Your wireless!\" he cried in delight. \"Everything is here, even to the aerial. Only the spreaders are lacking. We could make them and have this outfit set up in no time if we had to. Isn't it bully? Now we can talk directly with each other as soon as you learn to send and read. Won't that be dandy?\" With practiced eye he once more glanced over the outfit to make sure everything was there. Then he tied the box up again.  \"I'll just take it back with me,\" he added. \"This goes to your house, you know, and you can pick it up on your way home. We'll take it as far as the battery and leave it there.\"  They strode rapidly along the trail, and in half an hour reached the battery where the ranger had set it down. Some traps lay on top of the battery.  \"I forgot to bring them sooner,\" said the ranger.  Charley lifted the box. \"How in the world,\" he said, \"did you ever pack that thing over these mountains on your back? Why, you've carried that more than four miles.\"  \"We'll cut a couple of saplings and tie them to the box for handles,\" said the ranger. \"Then we can carry it easily. Give me your axe.\"  Charley handed his little axe to the ranger, and began to fumble in his pocket for the cord which he had used as a leash for his dog. The ranger looked around him for suitable poles. Close by the trail lay the rotting trunk of a large tree that had fallen years before. On the far side of this log and close to it some fine saplings had grown up, probably made thrifty by the rotting wood of the great tree. The ranger reached over the log to chop a sapling. At the same instant the pup, ranging in the bushes, growled savagely. Momentarily the ranger lifted his eyes, letting his axe head sink to the ground. Something moved under it, and at the same instant a hideous head reared itself above the leaves and struck with lightning-like rapidity, hitting the ranger just above the wrist-bone. With a startled exclamation the ranger drew up his arm. As he did so, a huge rattler glided away through the brush.  Charley turned at the ranger's cry. He comprehended the situation at a glance. \"Quick!\" he cried, springing to the ranger's side. \"Give me your arm.\"  He jerked back the ranger's sleeve, disclosing two dark spots on the back of the wrist where the fangs had punctured the skin. Drops of blood were oozing from them. Charley whipped out his knife and without hesitation drew the keen blade several times across the ranger's wrist. Blood began to flow down the hand. Putting his lips to the wound, Charley sucked out mouthful after mouthful of blood, which he spat on the ground.  \"Now squeeze your wrist tight just above the bite,\" said Charley. \"Stop the circulation of blood if you can.\"  Like a flash Charley picked up the dog leash and tied an end of it around the ranger's arm, close to the shoulder, drawing it so tight that the ranger winced. He cut the dangling end and took a second turn just above the ranger's elbow. Then he made a third turn half-way down the forearm. With little sticks he twisted the cords still tighter. Then he jerked out his hypodermic syringe, which he carried already filled with fluid, and thrusting the needle into the bleeding arm, injected the permanganate into the wound.  Meantime, the ranger stood silent, his face pale, his jaws set courageously. \"Where did you learn to do all that?\" he finally asked Charley, with evident admiration. \"You go about it like a doctor.\"  \"When the Wireless Patrol was in camp at Fort Brady,\" replied Charley, \"one of the fellows was bitten by a copperhead. Dr. Hardy had already drilled us in first-aid and we knew just what to do. You bet none of us will ever forget.\"  \"I shall owe my life to you,\" said Mr. Morton. \"That is, I shall if----\"  \"There's no if about it,\" interrupted Charley with determination. \"We got most of the poison out of your arm. I'll bet on that. What's left may make you sick, but it can't kill you. What we've got to do is to prevent that poison from reaching your heart, at least in any quantity. You sit down against this tree and keep quiet so your heart will beat as slow as possible. In about twenty minutes loosen this bottom cord. Loosen the middle one after another twenty minutes, and open the third at the end of an hour. That's all I know how to do. Thank God, we've got a wireless here! Now I'm going to get it up as quick as possible.\"  He tore open the pasteboard boxes and took out one instrument after another, coupling up the wires quickly and skilfully. Then he seized the little axe, chopped some branches for spreaders, fastened the aerial wires to them, and added other wires to suspend them by. Quickly he selected two trees for supports, and climbing up first one and then the other, soon had his aerial dangling directly above the fire trail. He coupled up his lead-in wire and ran his eye over the outfit. Everything was complete. Only the power was lacking. With the axe he pried off the lid of the box containing the battery, tore away the paper and excelsior wrappings, and in another moment had his wires around the binding posts. He threw over his switch, and springing to his key pressed his finger on it. A brilliant flash shot between the points of his spark-gap.  \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he rapped out. (Camp Brady Wireless Club, Charley Russell calling.)  Then he sat in silence, waiting for an answer. It came promptly.  \"CBC--CBC--CBC--I--I--I--GA.\" (Charley Russell--We're here. Go ahead.)  \"Got 'em,\" he cried. He answered and got a reply. \"They want to know why we didn't call up last night,\" Charley said to Lew.  The fire in the little fireplace burned clear and bright, making a circle of light in the dark forest. Lew sat near the fire, cross-legged on his pack bag, thrusting an occasional stick into the flames. Charley sat by his instrument. Rapidly he pressed the key, and the sparks flew between the points of his gap like tiny flashes of horizontal lightning.  \"Hello! Is that you, Willie?\" rapped out Charley.  \"Sure,\" came the answer. \"But we're all here. Why didn't you call up last night?\"  \"Couldn't,\" answered Charley. \"Didn't reach Old Ironsides camp site until long after dark. Forest fires have burned up all the timber there. Spring dried up, too. Had terrible time. Awful thirsty and no water to drink. Too tired to put up aerial.\"  \"Where are you now?\"  \"In the third valley east of Old Ironsides. Never been so far in the mountains before. Grand stand of timber here. Great trout stream. Full of big ones. Won't touch worms or flies. Just been catching crabs to try to-morrow.\"  \"Get any yet?\"  \"One big one.\"  \"Have any adventures?\"  \"Not unless you call our experience in the burned timber an adventure. Toughest thing I've stacked up against in a long time. Timber burned for miles. No fish. Raccoons catching 'em out of the little pools. Had to come here to get any. What are you doing?\"  \"Everybody hard at work. I got a new job yesterday helping a fellow make a wireless outfit.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Right here. We're making it in my shop.\"  \"Will you be there to-morrow?\"  \"Sure. All day.\"  \"We'll call you.\"  \"Good! I'll listen in every hour on the hour. Then you can get me almost any time.\"  \"Bully for you. We're going to fish to-morrow, but we may catch so many in the morning that we won't want to fish after dinner. I'll let you know how we make out. Good luck to you all. Wish you were here. We'll bring you a nice mess of fish, anyway. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night and good luck.\"  \"I wish they were here,\" said Lew, as Charley covered the instruments to protect them from dampness, and moved over near his chum. \"It doesn't seem right to be in the forest without the whole crowd. This makes me think of our camp in the forest near the Elk City reservoir, when we were hot on the trail of the dynamiters. I'd hate to camp out at this time of year without any fire.\"  \"Well, let's turn in. We want to get up early to-morrow and try those crabs. I'll bet we get a bunch of trout.\"  \"Bet we do, too,\" replied Charley.  Little did he dream that on the morrow he would be engaged in matters far more serious than catching trout.     Chapter VII  The Forest Afire    The earliest rays of light had hardly penetrated beneath the giant pines the next morning before the two boys were astir. Their breakfast was quickly cooked and eaten. Then they buckled on their bait boxes and started. \"I don't see any way to cross now and there's no time to hunt for a way.\"  \"It's full of 'em. I'll bet on that,\" smiled Charley. \"We'll catch a mess in no time. Here goes with a worm.\"  He threaded one on his hook, crouched down, and cautiously drew near the bank. A dexterous flick of his rod landed the worm fairly in the middle of the run. Hardly had it hit the water before something grabbed it, and Charley drew forth a flopping fish. But it proved to be only a fingerling. In disgust Charley wet his hand and carefully unhooked the little fish.  \"Shows they're here, anyway,\" he said, as he tossed the little trout back into the stream.  But if they were there, they were strangely shy in making their presence known. Rod after rod the hoys advanced, careful not to show themselves, making their casts with greatest caution, and keeping as quiet as possible. But no fish so much as smelled their bait. Again and again they let their hooks float down into promising pools, but never a strike resulted.  They took the worms from their hooks and tried flies. But though their gaudy lures landed lightly on the water and danced in the rapids like real insects struggling for their lives, never a fish rose to grasp one.  \"They won't touch worms and they don't want flies. I wonder what they do like,\" grumbled Lew in disgust. \"I wish we had some grasshoppers or crickets. Bet we'd get 'em then.\"  They continued their efforts until it was almost dark. \"We'll have to be getting back to camp,\" said Charley. \"We can't see much longer. We don't want to be caught here in the dark. The flash-light is back at camp.\"  \"Here's a fat grub,\" said Lew, picking up a whiteworm out of a rotting log. \"I'm going to make one more try. Maybe they want grubs.\"  He slipped the worm on his hook and flicked it toward the brook. A second after it struck the water there was a splash, and Lew's reel sang shrilly.  \"Oh boy!\" cried Lew, as he struck up his rod smartly. \"I've got him.\"  He had. The fish leaped clear of the water, but failed to loosen the line. Then it darted away like a shot, the line cutting through the water with a sharp, swishing sound.  \"Hold him,\" called Charley. \"He's heading for that snag.\"  Lew put his thumb on the line and raised the tip of his rod higher. Under the tension the supple steel bent almost double. The fish stopped his rush, turned, and darted down-stream before Lew could reel in a foot of line.  Charley forgot all about his own fishing in his desire to help land the trout. \"Don't let him get under that rock,\" he warned, coming close to the brook. \"He'll cut the line.\"  Lew increased the tension on the line and the fish stopped short of the rock. For an instant the trout sulked and Lew reeled in rapidly.  \"Guess I got him,\" he cried triumphantly, as the fish was drawn near to the bank. But as he bent to grasp his prize there was a tremendous splash. The trout leaped high out of water, then darted off again like a flash. Lew had to give him line or lose him.  \"He's a whopper, Charley,\" he cried. \"Gee! I hope I don't lose him!\"  \"Here's a shallow place,\" cried Charley. \"Work him into it and we can grab him.\"  Lew maneuvered the trout toward the shoal. Again and again the fish broke for the deeper water and Lew had to give him line. But each time he stopped the rush and patiently worked the fish back toward the shoal. At last the trout was fairly on the edge of it. Lew began to pull steadily on his line and slid the tired fish into shallow water. It flopped helplessly on the stones. Lew drew it to the bank and thrust a finger into its gills. In another second the fish was dangling in air.  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" cried Charley excitedly. \"Ain't he a beaut! He's the biggest trout I ever saw.\"  \"He's the biggest one I ever caught,\" answered Lew. \"He'll make a meal himself.\"  \"He'll have to,\" returned Charley. \"We can't fish another minute. It's almost dark now.\"  Lew slipped his finger down the throat of the gasping fish, and bent the creature's head sharply back. The trout hung limp in his hand. Then the two fishermen made their way through the dusky forest to their camp, where Charley lighted a fire.  \"I'll just see what this fellow has been eating,\" said Lew. \"Maybe we can find out what sort of bait to use.\" He opened his knife and slit the fish's belly. \"Crabs!\" he cried, as his knife blade turned up the remains of a crayfish. \"Now we know what they want.\"  Soon Charley had a good bed of coals. Lew, meantime, cleaned the fish. Quickly it was cooked and eaten and the dishes washed. By this time it was altogether dark.  \"Now we'll get some crabs for to-morrow,\" said Lew.  \"Wonder how we can catch them?\" queried Charley.  \"What we need is a little dip-net. With that and the flash-light we could get a peck of them. These little streams are full of them.\"  \"Let's try scooping them with a coffee-pot. The lid comes off. If we are careful, I believe it will answer.\"  They took the lid off of the pot, and stepping to the brook turned the beam from their flash-light on the bottom of the run. The scene was fascinating. Feeling secure in the darkness, the living creatures in the brook had ventured abroad freely. Where the bright light of the sun would have disclosed only stones and sand, the little beam from the search-light revealed a myriad of moving shapes. Little minnows moved about in schools. Salamanders, large and small, crawled about among the rocks. Occasional trout were visible, lurking in the deeper holes, lying as motionless as sticks, or moving their tails slowly. Eels lay on the sandy spots. And lying still or crawling slowly among the stones were many crayfish. The water seemed to be filled with living objects.  \"Gee whiz!\" whispered Charley. \"It's like going to an aquarium and looking at the fish in glass cages. I never dreamed a brook could be so interesting.\"  With the utmost caution they moved along the bank of the run, looking for crayfish of suitable size. Whenever they found one, Charley focused the flash-light on it, moving the beam so as to dazzle the creature and keep the space behind it in darkness. And Lew would slip the coffee-pot into the water and move it cautiously up to the crayfish, ready for a final, quick scoop. Sometimes he was successful and sometimes the intended victim escaped. Always the click of the metal pot against the stony bottom sent the little creatures in the water scurrying for cover. A second after Lew tried for the crayfish not a living thing was visible. So it was necessary to move on along the stream. From spot to spot the two boys proceeded, now getting a good bait, now missing one, but ever keenly enjoying the wonderful glimpses of the life in the brook. So they continued until they had a goodly number of crayfish.  \"I believe that's enough,\" said Lew. \"Let's get back to camp. The fellows will be at their instruments at nine, ready to talk to us.\" He glanced at his watch. \"I had no idea,\" he cried, \"that it was so late. It's almost nine now. We'll have to hurry.\"  So fascinating had been the glimpses of life in the brook that time had sped much faster than either boy realized.  They hurried back to their camp. They had taken the precaution to sling their grub high above ground on a piece of wire, but apparently nothing had tried to molest anything. Lew rekindled the fire in the little stone fireplace they had built and Charley uncovered the wireless instruments and sat down on one pack bag. The other he flung to Lew. Then he slipped the receivers on his head, threw over his switch, and sent the bright sparks flashing between the points of his spark-gap.  \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he rapped out. (Camp Brady Wireless Club, Charley Russell calling.)  Then he sat in silence, waiting for an answer. It came promptly.  \"CBC--CBC--CBC--I--I--I--GA.\" (Charley Russell--We're here. Go ahead.)  \"Got 'em,\" he cried. He answered and got a reply. \"They want to know why we didn't call up last night,\" Charley said to Lew.  The fire in the little fireplace burned clear and bright, making a circle of light in the dark forest. Lew sat near the fire, cross-legged on his pack bag, thrusting an occasional stick into the flames. Charley sat by his instrument. Rapidly he pressed the key, and the sparks flew between the points of his gap like tiny flashes of horizontal lightning.  \"Hello! Is that you, Willie?\" rapped out Charley.  \"Sure,\" came the answer. \"But we're all here. Why didn't you call up last night?\"  \"Couldn't,\" answered Charley. \"Didn't reach Old Ironsides camp site until long after dark. Forest fires have burned up all the timber there. Spring dried up, too. Had terrible time. Awful thirsty and no water to drink. Too tired to put up aerial.\"  \"Where are you now?\"  \"In the third valley east of Old Ironsides. Never been so far in the mountains before. Grand stand of timber here. Great trout stream. Full of big ones. Won't touch worms or flies. Just been catching crabs to try to-morrow.\"  \"Get any yet?\"  \"One big one.\"  \"Have any adventures?\"  \"Not unless you call our experience in the burned timber an adventure. Toughest thing I've stacked up against in a long time. Timber burned for miles. No fish. Raccoons catching 'em out of the little pools. Had to come here to get any. What are you doing?\"  \"Everybody hard at work. I got a new job yesterday helping a fellow make a wireless outfit.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Right here. We're making it in my shop.\"  \"Will you be there to-morrow?\"  \"Sure. All day.\"  \"We'll call you.\"  \"Good! I'll listen in every hour on the hour. Then you can get me almost any time.\"  \"Bully for you. We're going to fish to-morrow, but we may catch so many in the morning that we won't want to fish after dinner. I'll let you know how we make out. Good luck to you all. Wish you were here. We'll bring you a nice mess of fish, anyway. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night and good luck.\"  \"I wish they were here,\" said Lew, as Charley covered the instruments to protect them from dampness, and moved over near his chum. \"It doesn't seem right to be in the forest without the whole crowd. This makes me think of our camp in the forest near the Elk City reservoir, when we were hot on the trail of the dynamiters. I'd hate to camp out at this time of year without any fire.\"  \"Well, let's turn in. We want to get up early to-morrow and try those crabs. I'll bet we get a bunch of trout.\"  \"Bet we do, too,\" replied Charley.  Little did he dream that on the morrow he would be engaged in matters far more serious than catching trout.     Chapter VII  The Forest Afire    The earliest rays of light had hardly penetrated beneath the giant pines the next morning before the two boys were astir. Their breakfast was quickly cooked and eaten. Then they buckled on their bait boxes and started. \"I don't see any way to cross now and there's no time to hunt for a way.\"  \"It's full of 'em. I'll bet on that,\" smiled Charley. \"We'll catch a mess in no time. Here goes with a worm.\"  He threaded one on his hook, crouched down, and cautiously drew near the bank. A dexterous flick of his rod landed the worm fairly in the middle of the run. Hardly had it hit the water before something grabbed it, and Charley drew forth a flopping fish. But it proved to be only a fingerling. In disgust Charley wet his hand and carefully unhooked the little fish.  \"Shows they're here, anyway,\" he said, as he tossed the little trout back into the stream.  But if they were there, they were strangely shy in making their presence known. Rod after rod the hoys advanced, careful not to show themselves, making their casts with greatest caution, and keeping as quiet as possible. But no fish so much as smelled their bait. Again and again they let their hooks float down into promising pools, but never a strike resulted.  They took the worms from their hooks and tried flies. But though their gaudy lures landed lightly on the water and danced in the rapids like real insects struggling for their lives, never a fish rose to grasp one.  \"They won't touch worms and they don't want flies. I wonder what they do like,\" grumbled Lew in disgust. \"I wish we had some grasshoppers or crickets. Bet we'd get 'em then.\"  They continued their efforts until it was almost dark. \"We'll have to be getting back to camp,\" said Charley. \"We can't see much longer. We don't want to be caught here in the dark. The flash-light is back at camp.\"  \"Here's a fat grub,\" said Lew, picking up a whiteworm out of a rotting log. \"I'm going to make one more try. Maybe they want grubs.\"  He slipped the worm on his hook and flicked it toward the brook. A second after it struck the water there was a splash, and Lew's reel sang shrilly.  \"Oh boy!\" cried Lew, as he struck up his rod smartly. \"I've got him.\"  He had. The fish leaped clear of the water, but failed to loosen the line. Then it darted away like a shot, the line cutting through the water with a sharp, swishing sound.  \"Hold him,\" called Charley. \"He's heading for that snag.\"  Lew put his thumb on the line and raised the tip of his rod higher. Under the tension the supple steel bent almost double. The fish stopped his rush, turned, and darted down-stream before Lew could reel in a foot of line.

Then he slipped the receivers on his head, threw over his switch, and sent the bright sparks flashing between the points of his spark-gap. Twice he called, then a bright smile came over his face. \"Got him,\" he said.  For some moments he alternately worked his key and listened to the return buzzing in his receiver. Then he turned to the ranger. \"Did you learn your alphabet?\" he repeated.  \"I've been working at it a little,\" said the ranger. \"To tell the truth, I don't care much about it. I'd just as soon stick to the telephone. But the wife is crazy over it. She says if we knew how to do it and had the instruments, we could talk at any time. She's learned the alphabet already.\"  \"She has! Bully for her!\" cried Charley. \"Hurry up with that outfit, Lew, so we can teach her to send and read. I'll be glad to talk to her, even if her husband doesn't want to.\"  \"I'll be home by sunset,\" said Lew, \"and you can call me at eight o'clock. I shall have had a chance to talk to the fellows by that time and I hope that I shall have something good to report to you. I'm coming out the first Friday I can, to spend Saturday and Sunday with you. Good-bye.\"  Charley shook hands heartily with his two friends and turned back into the forest. Although he was still somewhat cast down, the intense depression that had weighed upon him during the morning was lightened. The events of the past twenty-four hours had made him forget temporarily the plan to teach Mr. Morton how to operate the wireless. But the news that the ranger's wife was also to become a radio operator pleased him more and more as he turned the matter over in his mind.  The pup, rubbing against his heels, recalled another matter to his mind. He had to train the dog to be useful to him.  \"No time like the present,\" muttered Charley to himself.  His face was grim and set as he started along the line of the fire. There was no reply. At least Charley heard none.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he cried. \"Where are you?\"  But no voice answered through the smoke.  \"If he's down, I'll find him or die trying,\" muttered Charley to himself.  His face was grim and set as he started along the line of the fire. There was no reply. At least Charley heard none.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he cried. \"Where are you?\"  But no voice answered through the smoke.  \"If he's down, I'll find him or die trying,\" muttered Charley to himself.  His face was grim and set as he started along the line of the fire. There was no reply. At least Charley heard none.  \"Lew! Lew!\" he cried. \"Where are you?\"  But no voice answered through the smoke.  \"If he's down, I'll find him or die trying,\" muttered Charley to himself.  Then he stood stock-still. Shout after shout came ringing in his ears. \"It <i>is</i> a real voice,\" he cried. \"The fire crew is coming.\"  A moment later a dozen forms became visible in the smoke. They were running along the edge of the fire, evidently trying to determine where to begin their attack on it. At their head was the forester. He came directly toward Charley, but gave no sign of recognition. Nor, could Charley have seen himself, would he have wondered at it. With his face blackened by smoke and caked with blood from innumerable little cuts and scratches, his hands grimy and almost raw, and his clothes torn in a hundred places, Charley could hardly have been recognized by his own mother.  \"How far across the valley does this fire extend?\" asked the forester.  \"You are almost at the end of it, sir,\" replied Charley.  \"It's making a tremendous smoke for such a little blaze, then,\" said the forester.  He turned to his men. \"Get right at it and beat it out,\" he ordered. \"This is all there is to it.\"  Again he faced Charley. \"Are you sure?\" he demanded. \"When we came over the pass it looked as though the entire bottom was afire.\"  \"It was,\" said Charley. \"That is, everything this side of the run was afire. We have got it all out but this.\"  \"Have you seen anything of two boys with a wireless outfit? They notified me of this fire.\"  \"Why, I am one of them, sir. It was I who asked you yesterday for a job as fire patrol.\"  The forester looked at him with renewed interest. \"As a patrol,\" he remarked, \"you would have to deal with grown men. You would find yourself in many situations that you could not handle. Grown men do not like to take orders from boys.\"  \"I have handled men, sir; that is, I have helped to handle them. I helped to capture the German dynamiters at Elk City, sir, when the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol. With his fellows he had taken part in the capture of the German spies who were trying to dynamite the Elk City reservoir and so wreck a great munitions centre during the war; and with three other members of the Wireless Patrol can go along? We'll miss 'em, particularly Roy. And now that he's wireless man on the <i>Lycoming</i>, he'll probably never go on another trip with the Camp Brady Patrol.\"  \"It's too bad for us, but mighty nice for Roy,\" said Charley. \"Just think of being the wireless man on a big ocean steamer when you're only nineteen. I wish I knew what I am going to do.\"  \"I know how you feel, Charley. Maybe something will turn up so that you won't need to go into the factory after all. But here we are at the lumber-yard. Let's get the boards and begin our boat at once. We'll have a good time this vacation, no matter what happens afterward.\"  \"Well, boys, what can I do for you?\" inquired the lumber dealer, as Charley and Lew approached him.  \"We want one hundred feet of the lightest and best boards you have,\" replied Charley. \"We are going to build a boat and we want it to be strong but light, so that the two of us can handle it.\"  \"White pine would be just the thing for you,\" replied the dealer, \"but I haven't a foot of it in the place and can't get any. I have some fine cedar boards that would make a good light boat. Just come over to this pile of lumber.\" And he led the way across the yard.  \"That will suit us all right if it's wide enough,\" said Charley. \"We want foot boards.\"  \"Well, that's what these are. And a good inch thick, too. They're mighty good boards. Hardly a knot in 'em. We don't see much lumber like that nowadays.\"  \"They'll do all right,\" assented Charley, after examining the boards. \"What do they cost a hundred?\"  \"Ten dollars.\"  \"Ten dollars!\" cried Charley in consternation. Then a smile came on his face. \"Quit your kidding,\" he said. \"What <i>do</i> they come at?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.

The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the man. His voice was sharp and a frown had gathered on his forehead. \"Ten dollars, and cheap at that.\"  Charley turned to his companion with a look of dismay. \"We can never build our boat with wood at such a price,\" he cried. \"With five dollars to pay for oars, and two dollars for paint, and some more for nails and rowlocks, and lock and chain, the boat would cost eighteen or twenty dollars just for the materials. That's three times as much as we have got.\"  After an instant the look on Charley's face changed to one of intense indignation. He had a quick temper, and now he turned to the lumber dealer in anger.  \"I guess the sugar profiteers are not the only ones who ought to be in the penitentiary,\" he said hotly. \"You can keep your old boards. And I hope they rot for you.\"  Then he turned on his heel and started toward the gate, followed by Lew.  \"Come back here!\"  The words rang out sharp and sudden. The voice was commanding and compelling. Involuntarily the two boys turned back. The lumber dealer stood before them, his face ablaze with indignation. Under his fiery glances the boys were speechless. For a moment the man said nothing. Evidently he was struggling with his temper. When he had gotten control of himself he spoke. His voice was deep and low, but harsh and cutting.  \"Before you make a fool of yourself again, young man,\" he said, speaking directly to Charley, \"you had better know what you are talking about. You called me a profiteer for asking $100 a thousand feet for those cedar boards. Young man, those boards cost me $90 a thousand in the cars at the station. That leaves me a margin of $10 a thousand for handling them. Out of that I have to pay to have the boards hauled from the station, pay for insurance on them, pay their proportionate share of overhead expense, and pay for hauling them to customers. How much of that $10 do you think is left for profit? So little it almost requires a microscope to see it. I have to handle a good many hundred feet of lumber to make as much as the cheapest sort of laborer gets for a day's pay. The fact is, young man, that far from profiteering on that lumber, I am selling it at a smaller profit than I ever sold any lumber before in my life. Some lumber I am handling at a loss. But in these critical days, with factories closing everywhere, and men by the thousands being thrown out of work, the best thing a man can do, either for himself or for his country, is to keep business moving. That's why I am selling lumber without profit.\"  Charley was suddenly abashed. He turned his glance on the ground. He did not know what to say.  After a moment the forester spoke again. A new idea seemed suddenly to have occurred to him. \"Now that you have had a taste of real fire fighting,\" he said, \"would you still like to be a fire patrol--possibly a ranger?\"  \"Better than anything in the world,\" replied Charley. \"I love the forest.\"  \"Are you sure you can be released from further school work?\"  \"I feel certain I can.\"  \"Then I have a particular job for you, Mr. Fire Guard.\"  \"Mr. Fire Guard,\" echoed Charley, his heart beating wildly. \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean,\" smiled the forester, \"that you are here and now appointed a fire patrol; that you are now a representative of the State of Pennsylvania, and after you have been sworn in you will have the power of making arrests. The particular job I have for you is to guard this forest. Somebody wants to destroy this stand of virgin timber. Your job is to protect it.\"     Chapter VIII  Making an Investigation    The fire crew, hardy woodsmen and rangers, accustomed to severe toil, soon beat out what was left of the fire. Then they went over the entire line of the fire to make sure every spark was extinguished. The forester and Charley found Lew, and the three crossed the valley to the brook where the two boys had begun their battle with the flames. When the fire crew had returned and the forester was satisfied that there was no further danger, he turned and held out his hand.  \"Report to me at my office at the earliest possible moment,\" he said. \"If I dared risk being away from my headquarters so long,\" he added regretfully, \"I'd stay here and make an investigation. But a fire may start somewhere else, and here I'd be with my fire crew. A thousand acres might burn over before I knew it.\"  \"Isn't there anybody in charge at headquarters?\" asked Charley.  \"Sure. I have an assistant there. But if an alarm came in he wouldn't be of much use without a fire crew.\"  \"Send your fire crew back,\" said Charley. \"You can stay here and make your investigation, and we can keep you in touch with your office easily.\"  \"Are you sure?\"  \"There isn't any doubt of it. Willie said he would listen in every hour.\"  \"Hurry,\" said Lew sharply. \"I'll keep at work here.\"  \"If it gets too hot for you,\" said Charley, \"go right back to the brook, and come up along it to camp. That's the way I'm going back, and I'll return that way after I get Willie. Good-bye.\"  He started off at a fast pace. But his exertions and the heat and smoke had so weakened him that he quickly saw he could not maintain such a gait. He dropped to a steady jog. Even that taxed his strength. But he gritted his teeth and clenched his hands and kept on.  The forest was now full of smoke. The dense cloud completely hid the sun. Among the great pines it was almost like twilight. Charley pushed on as fast as his weary legs could carry him. More than once he tripped and fell. He could no longer see distinctly. Fatigue and the smoke in his eyes blurred his vision. He was scratched and torn and his hands were a mass of little burns. Charley scarcely noticed them. His mind was wholly intent on getting help and saving the forest. Nothing else mattered. So he staggered on through the dusky woods. He glanced at his watch. Ten minutes had passed. He felt sure he had been running an hour and that his watch had stopped. He held it to his ear. The steady ticking somewhat reassured him. After what seemed like another long interval he ventured to look at it again. Five minutes more had elapsed. Five minutes remained before Willie would be at his post waiting for a possible message. Charley crowded on all the speed that was left in him. But his feet seemed to be made of lead. His heart pounded painfully against his ribs. His lungs seemed nigh to bursting.  \"Five minutes more,\" he kept muttering to himself. \"Only five minutes more. I've got to make it. Only five minutes more.\"  Suddenly he came to their camp. In his weariness he had not recognized any landmarks. He could hardly believe it was their camp. But there were the grub bag hanging on a wire, the dishes piled by the fire, and the wireless instruments protected by the pack bags.  \"Thank God for the wireless!\" gasped Charley, as he threw himself on the ground beside his key. He tried to flash a call, but his hand trembled so he could not form the letters correctly. He dropped flat on his back to rest for a moment, glancing at his watch as he lay there. It lacked one minute of seven.  For sixty seconds Charley lay prostrate, looking at the second-hand on his watch as it went round. Then he sat up. The minute's rest had steadied him wonderfully. He moved his switch, pressed his finger on the key, and sent the bright sparks flashing between his gap points.  \"CBWC--CBWC--CBWC--CBC,\" he rapped out anxiously. And without listening for a reply, he repeated the message frantically half a dozen times. Then a buzzing sounded in his ears. A look of relief came on his face. He sighed. Willie was acknowledging his call signal.  \"Good-morning,\" continued Willie. \"Caught any trout yet?\"  \"The forest is afire!\" flashed back Charley. \"Get the district forester on the telephone instantly. His headquarters are at Oakdale. Tell him the fire is in the third valley east of Old Ironsides. Never been so far in the mountains before. Grand stand of timber here. Great trout stream. Full of big ones. Won't touch worms or flies. Just been catching crabs to try to-morrow.\"  \"Get any yet?\"  \"One big one.\"  \"Have any adventures?\"  \"Not unless you call our experience in the burned timber an adventure. Toughest thing I've stacked up against in a long time. Timber burned for miles. No fish. Raccoons catching 'em out of the little pools. Had to come here to get any. What are you doing?\"  \"Everybody hard at work. I got a new job yesterday helping a fellow make a wireless outfit.\"  \"Where?\"  \"Right here. We're making it in my shop.\"  \"Will you be there to-morrow?\"  \"Sure. All day.\"  \"We'll call you.\"  \"Good! I'll listen in every hour on the hour. Then you can get me almost any time.\"  \"Bully for you. We're going to fish to-morrow, but we may catch so many in the morning that we won't want to fish after dinner. I'll let you know how we make out. Good luck to you all. Wish you were here. We'll bring you a nice mess of fish, anyway. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night and good luck.\"  \"I wish they were here,\" said Lew, as Charley covered the instruments to protect them from dampness, and moved over near his chum. \"It doesn't seem right to be in the forest without the whole crowd. This makes me think of our camp in the forest near the Elk City reservoir, when we were hot on the trail of the dynamiters. I'd hate to camp out at this time of year without any fire.\"  \"Well, let's turn in. We want to get up early to-morrow and try those crabs. I'll bet we get a bunch of trout.\"  \"Bet we do, too,\" replied Charley.  Little did he dream that on the morrow he would be engaged in matters far more serious than catching trout.     Chapter VII  The Forest Afire    The earliest rays of light had hardly penetrated beneath the giant pines the next morning before the two boys were astir. Their breakfast was quickly cooked and eaten. Then they buckled on their bait boxes, now bulging with worms and crayfish. They carried as well their books of flies. And Charley slipped the little axe into his belt, to have something to chop with in case they wanted to hunt for whiteworms.  \"Let's go back where we caught that big fellow last night,\" said Lew. \"There may be some more like him in those deep pools.\"  \"All right. Come on.\"  With nothing but their little rods to carry, they made fast time through the forest, and had already reached the pool in which the big trout was taken, before the first ray of sunlight came flashing among the tree trunks.  \"We're going to have a fine day,\" said Charley. \"It's my turn to catch a fish. Here goes for a try.\"  He baited his hook with a crayfish, and cautiously made his way toward the brink of the brook. Half-way he paused and straightened up, sniffing the air. Then he turned and looked at Lew.  \"Smell anything?\" he asked.  Lew had also detected a taint in the fresh morning air. \"Smells like smoke,\" he said. \"Probably some fisherman cooking his breakfast.\"  Charley turned toward the brook again, then once more faced his companion.  \"People don't cook with leaves,\" he said soberly. \"That isn't wood smoke, that's burning leaves.\"  For a moment the two boys looked at each other in dismay.  \"You don't suppose the entire stream is like that, do you, Lew?\" asked Charley. \"There won't be a trout in it if it is.\" Then, after a pause, he added: \"What in the world do you suppose has become of the trout, anyway?\"  His question was soon answered, at least in part. Continuing along the bank of the run, the boys presently came to one of the deepest pools in the stream. In the crystal water they could see many trout, for there were no hiding-places in the pool at this low stage of water. Some of the fish were large. At the approach of the boys the frightened trout darted frantically about in the pool, vainly seeking cover.  Around the margins of this pool were innumerable little tracks in the earth. \"Raccoons!\" exclaimed Lew. \"There must have been dozens of them here.\"  But not until he found some little piles of fish-bones near the farther end of the pool did he grasp the significance of the tracks. He stopped in amazement.  \"Look here, Charley,\" he called, pointing to the piles of fish-bones. \"Those coons have been catching and eating trout.\" Then, after a moment's thought, he added, \"If this stream is like this in April, what will it be in August? There will be hardly a drop of water or a trout left. Why, this brook is ruined for years as a trout-stream--maybe forever. And it used to be absolutely the finest trout-stream in this part of the mountains.\"  Depressed and silent, the two lads continued along the brook. The mountains on either side of them and the entire bottom between lay black and desolate. But far up the run they could now see green foliage again, where the fire had been stopped.  \"Let's go on to those pines before we eat our breakfast,\" said Charley. \"It would make me sick to eat here in these ruins.\"  \"That's exactly the way I feel, too,\" replied Lew. \"It is the most awful thing I ever saw. Let's get out of it.\"  As rapidly as they could, they forced their way up-stream. The valley became narrower as they advanced. It was shaped like a huge wish-bone; and they were nearing the small end, where the mountains came together and formed a high knob. As the valley narrowed, the grade became much steeper, and their progress was correspondingly slower.  The pines they were heading for stood almost at the top of the knob at the crotch of the wish-bone. They were, therefore, at a considerable elevation. From the edge of these pines one would have to travel only a short distance to reach the very summit of the knob. After a hard walk the boys reached the end of the burned tract. They penetrated into the living forest far enough to shut out the sight of the dead forest they had just traversed. Then they threw down their packs and hastily set about cooking their breakfast.  \"Gee!\" cried Lew. \"I never was so glad to get away from anything in my life. I hope I shall never again see a sight like that. It fairly makes a fellow sick.\"  In their haste to start cooking, they were not as careful as they might have been in building their fire, and they made considerable smoke. Before they were half done eating, a man appeared farther up the run, advancing through the pines at great speed. He seemed to be in a big hurry until he caught sight of the two boys as they sat on the dry pine-needles. After that he came forward at an ordinary gait.  \"Good-morning, boys,\" he said pleasantly, as he drew near. Then, catching sight of their rods, he added, \"If you came to get fish, you struck a mighty poor place.\"  \"It used to be the best place for trout I ever saw,\" replied Lew. \"This brook used to be full of 'em--big ones, too. But the season has been so dry, the brook has almost disappeared.\"  \"You mean that the fires that have swept this valley have burned it up,\" replied the stranger.  \"It's too awful a thing to joke about,\" replied Lew.  \"A joke!\" exclaimed the stranger, frowning.  \"It's the literal truth--and a most terrible truth, at that.\"  \"I don't understand,\" said Lew, slowly. \"How can fire burn water? I supposed the lack of snow last winter and of rain this spring had made the brook shrink.\"  \"Not for a minute, young man, not for a minute. If fires hadn't swept this valley the past two or three years, there would have been plenty of water in the run, rain or no rain.\"  \"I--I don't exactly understand,\" said Lew hesitatingly.  \"It's like this,\" said the stranger. \"The forest floor is like a great sponge. The decayed leaves and twigs are so light and porous that they soak up most of the rain as it falls and hold the water indefinitely. That keeps the springs full, and the springs feed the brooks, and so there is water all the year round. It is nature's method of storing up water. When a fire sweeps through the forest, especially such awful fires as have gone through this valley, the leaves and twigs above ground are burned, and even the roots and the decaying vegetable matter under the earth are consumed. Nothing is left but mineral matter--particles of rock, stones, sand, and the like. The rain will no longer sink into the ground, nor will the earth hold the water as the rotting leaves do. Then when it rains, the water runs off as fast as it falls. The brooks are flooded for a few hours and then they dry up until another rain comes. So you see I meant exactly what I said. This trout-stream was burned up by the forest fires. Likewise many of the trout were burned up with it, for in places the fire made the water hotter than trout can stand. Thousands of them were literally cooked.\"  For a while both boys were silent. The idea was a new one to them.  Presently Charley spoke. \"I knew that fire burned up our timber,\" he said, \"but I never thought about its burning up our water, too. I know we're getting awful short of lumber. Is there any danger of our running out of water? But that can't be, surely.\"  \"It surely can be,\" said the stranger. \"I judge you boys have been here before, and-----\"  \"We have,\" interrupted Lew.  \"Then you know what a magnificent stream this run used to be. Look at it now. I don't believe there is one-tenth as much water in it as there used to be. Suppose all the mountains in this state should be devastated like this valley. Where would the towns and cities get their water?\"  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" said Lew. \"I never thought of that. There wouldn't be any water for them to get. If the brooks dried up, the rivers would dry up, too. Why--why--what in the world would we do? There wouldn't be any water to drink or wash in or cook with or run our factories. Why, great CÃ¦sar! If the forests vanished, I guess we'd be up against it. I never thought of the forests as furnishing anything but lumber. And I never thought much about that until we tried to buy a little lumber the other day and the dealer wanted ten dollars for half a dozen boards.\"  \"Exactly!\" said the stranger. \"That's the price you and I and the rest of us in Pennsylvania pay for allowing our forests to be destroyed.\"  \"They haven't all been destroyed,\" protested Lew.  \"No, but the greater part of them have been.\"  \"You don't mean really destroyed, do you?\" asked Lew.  \"Yes, sir. Absolutely destroyed. You came up this valley, didn't you?\"  \"Sure,\" said Charley.  \"Would you call the forest there destroyed?\"  \"If it isn't, I don't know how you would describe it,\" said Lew.  \"All right, then. There are some 45,000 square miles in this state. Originally practically all of that area was dense forests. The early settlers thought the timber would last forever and they cut and destroyed it recklessly. The lumbermen that followed were just as wasteful. It was all right to clear the land that was good for farming. But there are more than 20,000 square miles in this state. Originally practically all of that area was dense forests.

The early settlers thought the timber would last forever and they cut and destroyed it recklessly. The lumbermen that followed were just as wasteful. It was all right to clear the land that was good for farming. But there are more than 20,000 square miles in this state just like these mountains--land that is fit for nothing but the production of timber. None of that land is producing as much timber as it should. Much of it yields very little. And more than 6,400 square miles are absolutely desert, as bare and hideous as the burned valley below us. That's one acre in every seven in Pennsylvania. Think of it! Six thousand, four hundred square miles, an area larger than the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island put together, that is absolute desert! Every foot of that land ought to be producing timber for us. Then we should have lumber at a fraction of its present cost. You see the freight charges alone on the lumber used in this state are enormous.\"  \"That lumber dealer told us they amounted to $25,000,000 a year,\" replied Lew.  \"They do,\" assented the stranger. \"And when the new freight rates go into effect the cost of hauling our lumber to us will be something like $40,000,000 a year.\"  The two boys were very thoughtful as they made their way back to Charley's shop.  \"What are people going to do for wood pretty soon?\" Lew inquired of his companion. \"If we can't build a little boat because the wood costs too much, how are people going to get homes and furniture and wagons and motor-cars and a thousand other things? Seems to me pretty much everything we use is made of wood.\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Charley. \"At first I thought somebody was shooting at us. But I didn't hear any bullets hum. And the noise didn't sound exactly like a gun, either. It was like the noise a fellow makes when he hits the water real hard with a board.\"  In every direction they scanned the clearing. They saw no living things but the trees. \"It's queer,\" commented Charley. \"Let's look at that nearest tree that's down. Maybe we can learn something from it.\"  They walked over to the tree, then studied it in amazement. \"I never saw anything like that before,\" cried Lew. \"I don't believe that was ever cut with an axe. It looks as though it had been gnawed off.\"  \"It has,\" cried Charley with sudden excitement. \"I understand the whole thing now. We've found a colony of beavers. I never saw a live beaver, but I've read about them and seen pictures of their huts and their work, and that looks exactly like the pictures. And those noises like rifle-shots were their alarm signals. They slap the water with their tails when they are frightened and dive under water. I suppose they're all in their lodges now, and we'll never get a peep at them. Gee whiz! Just think of finding beavers, Lew, real beavers. I didn't know there were any in Pennsylvania.\"  \"It seems to me that I read something about the game commission stocking the state with them a few years ago. I think they put a number of them in the state forests. Doubtless they have multiplied in numbers and started new colonies.\"  \"That explains it,\" said Charley. \"Gee! I'm glad we found these fellows. And I'm just as glad that they aren't timber thieves. You know, Lew, it made me feel kind of queer to think of facing re\n"
